# Telegram Transport

## Overview

`TelegramClient` is the single transport for Telegram writes. It owns a
`TelegramOutbox` that serializes send/edit/delete operations, applies
coalescing, and enforces rate limits + retry-after backoff.

This document captures current behavior so transport changes stay intentional.

## Flow

1. Engine CLI emits JSONL events.
2. We render progress on every step and diff against the last output.
3. Only deltas enqueue a Telegram edit.
4. High-value messages enqueue a send.
5. All writes go through the outbox.

## Incoming messages

`parse_incoming_update` accepts text messages and voice notes.

### Voice transcription

If voice transcription is enabled, Untether downloads the Telegram voice payload once and tries the configured providers in order. The first successful transcript follows the same command and directive pipeline as typed text.

Configuration (under `[transports.telegram]`):

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.voice_transcription true
    untether config set transports.telegram.voice_transcription_providers '["avt", "groq", "local", "openai"]'
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    voice_transcription = true
    voice_transcription_providers = ["avt", "groq", "local", "openai"]
    voice_transcription_groq_api_key = "gsk_..." # for groq
    voice_transcription_local_backend = "whisper" # or "parakeet"
    voice_transcription_local_model = "small" # for local
    voice_transcription_api_key = "sk-..." # for openai
    voice_transcription_language = "en" # optional ISO-639-1 hint
    ```

Providers are attempted strictly in the configured order; any nonempty subset is valid. `avt` requires the external AVT CLI and `voice_transcription_local_command`; `groq` requires `voice_transcription_groq_api_key` or `GROQ_API_KEY`; `local` requires `pip install untether[whisper]` or `pip install untether[parakeet]`; and `openai` requires `voice_transcription_api_key` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`. The `groq` and `local` providers are native adapters ported from AVT (Apache-2.0), while `avt` remains an external process.

Each provider failure advances to the next. If all configured providers fail, Untether sends one provider-neutral `voice transcription is unavailable` reply and skips the run. Provider settings are hot-reloadable.

### Trigger mode (mentions-only)

Telegram’s bot privacy mode stops bots from seeing every message by default, but
**admins always receive all messages** in groups. If you promote untether to admin,
Telegram will deliver every update even when privacy mode is enabled.

To restore “only respond when invoked” behavior, use trigger mode:

- `all` (default): any message can start a run (subject to ignore rules).
- `mentions`: only start when explicitly invoked.

Explicit invocation includes any of:

- `@botname` mention in the message.
- `/<engine-id>` or `/<project-alias>` as the first token.
- Replying to a bot message.
- Built-in or plugin slash commands (for example `/agent`, `/model`, `/reasoning`, `/file`, `/listen`).

Note: In forum topics, some Telegram clients include `reply_to_message` on every
message, pointing at the topic’s root service message (`message_id ==
message_thread_id`). Untether treats those as implicit topic references, not
explicit replies, so they do not trigger mentions-only mode.

Commands:

- `/listen` shows the current mode and defaults.
- `/listen mentions` restricts runs to explicit invocations.
- `/listen all` restores the default behavior.
- `/listen clear` clears a topic override (topics only).

`/trigger` continues to work as a deprecated alias for one release cycle ([#297](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/297)) and prints a one-line deprecation notice on each invocation.

In group chats, changing listen mode requires the sender to be an admin.

State is stored in `telegram_chat_prefs_state.json` (chat default) and
`telegram_topics_state.json` (topic overrides) alongside the config file.

### Forwarded message coalescing

Telegram sends a "comment + forwards" burst as separate messages, with the comment
arriving first. Untether waits briefly so it can attach the forwarded messages and
run once.

Behavior:

- When a prompt candidate arrives, Untether waits for `forward_coalesce_s` seconds
  of quiet for that sender + chat/topic.
- Forwarded messages arriving during the window are appended to the prompt
  (separated by blank lines) and do not start their own runs.
- Forwarded messages by themselves do not start runs.

Configuration (under `[transports.telegram]`):

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.forward_coalesce_s 1.0
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    forward_coalesce_s = 1.0 # set 0 to disable the delay
    ```

### Media group coalescing

When a user sends multiple documents as a Telegram media group (album), Telegram
delivers them as separate messages sharing a `media_group_id`. Untether buffers
these messages and processes them as a single batch once the group is complete.

Behavior:

- Messages with a `media_group_id` are collected by the `MediaGroupBuffer`.
- After `media_group_debounce_s` seconds of quiet (no new messages in the same
  group), the buffer flushes and routes the group to `handle_media_group`.
- Each flush resets the debounce timer if new messages arrive before it fires.

Configuration (under `[transports.telegram]`):

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.media_group_debounce_s 1.0
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    media_group_debounce_s = 1.0 # set 0 to disable the delay
    ```

## Chat sessions

Session mode determines how conversations continue — this is the core difference between the three [workflow modes](../modes.md):

- **Assistant / Workspace** (`session_mode = "chat"`) — auto-resume; messages continue the last session automatically
- **Handoff** (`session_mode = "stateless"`) — reply-to-continue; each message starts a new run unless you reply to a previous one

Configuration (under `[transports.telegram]`):

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.show_resume_line true
    untether config set transports.telegram.session_mode "chat"
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    show_resume_line = true # set false to hide resume lines
    session_mode = "chat" # or "stateless"
    ```

Behavior:

- Stores one resume token per engine per chat (per sender in group chats).
- Auto-resumes when no explicit resume token is present.
- Reply resume lines always take precedence and update the stored session for that engine.
- Reset with `/new`.

State is stored in `telegram_chat_sessions_state.json` alongside the config file.

Set `show_resume_line = false` to hide resume lines when untether can auto-resume
(topics or chat sessions) and a project context is resolved. Otherwise the resume
line stays visible so reply-to-continue still works.

## Message overflow

By default, untether splits long final responses across multiple messages to stay
under Telegram's 4096 character limit after entity parsing. You can opt into
trimming instead:

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.message_overflow "trim"
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [transports.telegram]
    message_overflow = "trim" # trim | split
    ```

Split mode sends multiple messages. Each chunk includes the footer; follow-up
chunks add a "continued (N/M)" header.

## Forum topics (workspace mode)

!!! info "Mode requirement"
    Forum topics are used by **workspace mode** only. Assistant and handoff modes don't use topics. See [Workflow modes](../modes.md) for the full comparison.

If you chose the **workspace** workflow during onboarding, topics are already enabled.
Topics bind Telegram forum threads to a project/branch and persist resume tokens per
topic, so replies keep the right context even after restarts.

Configuration (under `[transports.telegram]`):

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set transports.telegram.topics.enabled true
    untether config set transports.telegram.topics.scope "auto"
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml
    [transports.telegram.topics]
    enabled = true
    scope = "auto" # auto | main | projects | all
    ```

Requirements:

- `main`: `chat_id` must be a forum-enabled supergroup (topics enabled).
- `projects`: each `projects.<alias>.chat_id` must point to a forum-enabled
  supergroup for that project.
- `all`: both the main chat and each project chat must be forum-enabled.
- `auto`: if any project chats are configured, uses `projects`; otherwise `main`.
- The bot needs the **Manage Topics** permission in the relevant chat(s).

Commands:

- `main`: `/topic <project> @branch` creates a topic in the main chat and binds it.
- `projects`: `/topic @branch` creates a topic in the project chat and binds it.
- `all`: use `/topic <project> @branch` in the main chat, or `/topic @branch` in
  project chats.
- `/ctx` shows the bound context and stored session engines inside topics.
  Outside topics, `/ctx set ...` and `/ctx clear` bind the chat context.
- `/new` inside a topic cancels any running task and clears stored resume tokens for that topic.

State is stored in `telegram_topics_state.json` alongside the config file.
Delete it to reset all topic bindings and stored sessions.

Note: main chat topics do not assume a default project; topics must be bound
before running without directives.

## Outbox model

- Single worker processes one op at a time.
- Each op is keyed; only one pending op per key.
- New ops with the same key overwrite the payload but **do not** reset
  `queued_at` (fairness).

Keys (include `chat_id` to avoid cross-chat collisions):

- `("edit", chat_id, message_id)` for edits (coalesced).
- `("delete", chat_id, message_id)` for deletes.
- `("send", chat_id, replace_message_id)` when replacing a progress message.
- Unique key for normal sends.

Scheduling:

- Ordered by `(priority, queued_at)`.
- Priorities: send=0, delete=1, edit=2.
- Within a priority tier, the oldest pending op runs first.

## Callback answering

Inline-keyboard button presses (Approve/Deny, plan-outline Pause, `/config`
toggles, `AskUserQuestion` options) produce Telegram `callback_query` updates.
The Bot API requires us to call `answerCallbackQuery` within **30 seconds** of
the press; if we don't, the *user's* Telegram client surfaces
`BotResponseTimeoutError`. The work Untether then performs (writing control
responses to Claude's PTY, editing feedback messages, etc.) happens
independently — answering just clears the spinner.

Backends that want a visible toast ("Approved" / "Denied" / …) set
`answer_early = True` and provide `early_answer_toast(args_text) -> str | None`.
Dispatch hits `answerCallbackQuery` via that path **before** calling
`backend.handle(ctx)` so the Telegram ack never blocks on slow downstream
work. The invariant is covered by a regression test
(`tests/test_callback_dispatch.py::test_early_answer_fires_before_slow_handle`).

Every answer emits a structured INFO log for observability:

```
callback.answered command=<id> chat_id=<n>
  latency_ms=<ms>   # just the answerCallbackQuery HTTP round-trip
  total_ms=<ms>     # since the dispatcher entered handle_callback
  early=true|false  # whether the early-answer path fired
  has_toast=true|false
```

Use `journalctl --user -u untether --since ... | grep callback.answered` to
tell "we were fast, Telegram was slow" (high `latency_ms`) apart from "we were
slow before reaching Telegram" (high `total_ms` with low `latency_ms`).

Client-side `BotResponseTimeoutError` reports a round-trip that exceeded the
Bot API's 30 s window — they can still fire if Telegram itself is slow or if
the local network is congested, even when `latency_ms` is well under 30 s.
The ordering invariant above is what prevents *our* work from ever being
the cause.

## Rate limiting + backoff

- Per-chat pacing is computed from `private_chat_rps` and `group_chat_rps`.
  Defaults: 1.0 msg/s for private, 20/60 msg/s for groups (≈1 message every 3s).
- Pacing is enforced per-chat via `_next_at[chat_id]`; each chat tracks its own
  earliest-allowed send time independently.
- The worker picks the highest-priority ready op whose chat is not blocked.
  On 429, `retry_at` blocks all chats globally until the retry window expires.
- On 429, `RetryAfter` is raised using `parameters.retry_after` when present;
  if missing, we fall back to a 5s delay. The outbox sets `retry_at` and
  requeues the op if no newer op for the same key has arrived.

## Error handling

- Non-429 errors are logged and dropped (no retry).
- On `RetryAfter`, the op is retried unless a newer op superseded the same key.

## Replace progress messages

`send_message(replace_message_id=...)`:

- Drops any pending edit for that progress message.
- Enqueues the send at highest priority.
- If the send succeeds, enqueues a delete for the old progress message.

This keeps the final message first and avoids deleting progress if the send
fails.

## getUpdates

`get_updates` bypasses the outbox and retries on `RetryAfter` by sleeping
for the provided delay.

## Close semantics

`TelegramClient.close()` shuts down the outbox and closes the HTTP client.
Pending ops are failed with `None` (best-effort).
