# Commands & directives

This page documents Untether’s user-visible command surface: message directives, in-chat commands, and the CLI.

## Message directives

Untether parses the first non-empty line of a message for a directive prefix.

| Directive | Example | Effect |
|----------|---------|--------|
| `/<engine-id>` | `/codex fix flaky test` | Select an engine for this message. |
| `/<project-alias>` | `/happy-gadgets add escape-pod` | Select a project alias. |
| `@branch` | `@feat/happy-camera rewind to checkpoint` | Run in a worktree for the branch. |
| Combined | `/happy-gadgets @feat/flower-pin observe unseen` | Project + branch. |
| `--plan <prompt>` | `--plan inspect the deployment` | Run this message with a planning instruction. |
| `--goal <condition>` | `--goal tests pass` | Run autonomously until the stated condition; goal takes precedence over plan. |
| `--skill <name>` | `--skill reviewer check the diff` | Carry one-shot skill data. Untether does not inject it into native harnesses. |
| `--subagent <name>` | `--subagent reviewer inspect auth` | Select an agent for engines with a proven native flag (Claude and OpenCode). |

Notes:

- Directives are only parsed at the start of the first non-empty line.
- Parsing stops at the first non-directive token.
- If a reply contains a `dir:` line, Untether ignores new directives and uses the reply context.

See [Context resolution](context-resolution.md) for the full rules.

## Context footer (`dir:`)

When a run has project context, Untether appends a footer line as part of the `🏷` info line:

- With branch: `dir: <project> @<branch>`
- Without branch: `dir: <project>`

This line is parsed from replies and takes precedence over new directives. For backwards compatibility, Untether also accepts the older `ctx:` format when parsing replies.

## Telegram in-chat commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cancel` | Reply to the progress message to stop the current run. |
| `/agent` | Show/set the default engine for the current scope. |
| `/model` | Show/set the model override for the current scope. |
| `/reasoning` | Show/set the reasoning override for the current scope. |
| `/listen` | Show/set listen mode (`all` / `mentions` / `clear`) — controls whether the bot responds to every message in a group chat or only to @-mentions. Renamed from `/trigger` in v0.35.3 ([#297](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/297)); `/trigger` continues to work as a deprecated alias for one release cycle. |
| `/file put <path>` | Upload a document into the repo/worktree (requires file transfer enabled). |
| `/file get <path>` | Fetch a file or directory back into Telegram. Agents can also send files automatically via `.untether-outbox/` — see [file transfer](../how-to/file-transfer.md#agent-initiated-delivery-outbox). |
| `/topic <project> @branch` | Create/bind a topic (topics enabled). |
| `/ctx` | Show context binding (chat or topic). |
| `/ctx set <project> @branch` | Update context binding. |
| `/ctx clear` | Remove context binding. |
| `/planmode` | Toggle Claude Code plan mode (on/auto/off/show/clear). Claude Code only — non-Claude engines are directed to `/config` → Approval policy. |
| `/plan [on|off|clear|show]` | Show or set sticky plan prompting. Other `/plan <prompt>` forms run that prompt one-shot. |
| `/goal` | Show goal usage. `/goal <condition>` is a one-shot goal run. |
| `/subagent [show|off|clear]` | Show or clear the sticky subagent; `/subagent set <name>` stores one. `/subagent <name> <prompt>` is one-shot. |
| `/compact [instructions]` | Compact the active session. Handoff-only, explicit handoff, and cross-engine work require a confirmation card. |
| `/handoff [engine] [instructions]` | Create a summary, seed a new session, and route future messages only after destination completion succeeds. |
| `/usage` | Show Claude Code subscription usage (5h window, weekly, per-model). Claude Code only. Requires Claude Code OAuth credentials (see [troubleshooting](../how-to/troubleshooting.md#claude-code-credentials)). `/usage debug` appends a `🔧 debug` block with last-fetch wall time and freshness label, last-error class+message, OAuth token expiry, and the cumulative `claude_usage.schema_mismatch` counter ([#410](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/410)). |
| `/export` | Export last session transcript as Markdown or JSON. |
| `/browse` | Browse project files with inline keyboard navigation. |
| `/ping` | Health check — replies with uptime since last (re)start. Shows trigger summary if triggers target the current chat. |
| `/health` | System + triggers + cost snapshot — RAM/swap, Untether process (PID, RSS, FDs, children), trigger counts, today's API cost, uptime. Compact 6-line HTML message; sections degrade gracefully when sources are unavailable. See [operations](../how-to/operations.md#health-snapshot). |
| `/restart` | Gracefully drain active runs and restart Untether. |
| `/verbose` | Toggle verbose progress mode (on/off/clear). Shows tool details in progress messages. |
| `/config` | Interactive settings menu — plan mode, ask mode, verbose, engine, model, reasoning, listen-mode toggles with inline buttons. The `📡 Triggers` page (`config:tg`) lists per-chat crons (`describe_cron(...)` schedule, project, engine, last-fired) and webhooks (path, auth, project, engine, last-fired), capped at 10 entries with an overflow marker, plus a master pause/resume toggle ([#271](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/271), [#294](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/294)). |
| `/stats` | Per-engine session statistics — runs, actions, and duration for today, this week, and all time. Includes `(N triggered, M manual)` per-engine breakdown when at least one count is nonzero ([#271](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/271) Tier 3). Pass an engine name to filter (e.g. `/stats claude`). |
| `/auth` | Headless device re-authentication for Codex — runs `codex login --device-auth` and sends the verification URL + device code. `/auth status` checks CLI availability. Codex-only. |
| `/new` | Cancel any running task and clear stored sessions for the current scope (topic/chat). |
| `/continue [prompt]` | Resume the most recent session in the project directory. Picks up CLI-started sessions from Telegram. Optional prompt appended. Not supported for AMP. |
| `/at <duration> <prompt>` | Schedule a one-shot delayed run. Duration: `Ns` (60-9999s), `Nm`, or `Nh` (up to 24h). The chat's project mapping and engine are captured at schedule time and used at fire time (mirrors cron freeze-at-dispatch behaviour). Pending delays are cancelled via `/cancel` and lost on restart. Per-chat cap of 20 pending delays. Trigger-source provenance is stamped as `at:<token>` and rendered in the run footer (`⏰ at:<token>`), and the run counts toward `/stats` as triggered ([#271](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/271) follow-up). |

Notes:

- Outside topics, `/ctx` binds the chat context.
- In topics, `/ctx` binds the topic context.
- `/new` cancels running tasks and clears sessions but does **not** clear a bound context.
- `/continue` uses the engine's native "continue" flag: `--continue` (Claude, OpenCode, Pi), `resume --last` (Codex), or `--resume latest` (Gemini).
- Long-running tools (Bash, BashOutput, ScheduleWakeup, Monitor, …) surface a heartbeat-driven elapsed-time tail (`▸ Bash · 3m 47s · npm run build`) on the progress message after ~60s, regardless of `/verbose` state ([#481](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/481)). Tune via `[progress] heartbeat_interval`.
- Loop mode (Claude only): there is no `/loop` Telegram command — it's a Claude Code feature. Untether observes Claude's `ScheduleWakeup` and `CronCreate` tool calls and re-fires iterations after the subprocess exits. Off by default; opt in per chat via `/config` → 🔁 **Loop mode**. Cost protection lives in `[cost_budget]`, runaway-safety caps in `[loop]` ([#289](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/289)).
- `--goal` overrides `--plan`; sticky plan precedence is topic, then chat, then off. Explicit plan/goal always win over sticky state. Explicit subagent wins over its chat-scoped sticky value. Skill is one-shot only; Pi, OMP, Agy, and Codex have no proven skill/subagent native injection.
- Compact and handoff use one operation card. Confirm queues it, Cancel or expiry closes it, and a failed destination seed leaves existing session routing untouched. The optional handoff summary is content, not a second status card.
- Plan and goal appear in the ordinary prompt status/footer. Skill and subagent intentionally have no card badge.
