# Operations and monitoring

Untether runs as a long-lived process, typically in a terminal or managed by a process supervisor (systemd on Linux, etc.). This guide covers health checks, graceful restarts, diagnostics, and day-to-day operations — all controllable from [Telegram](https://telegram.org) without SSH.

## Health check

Send `/ping` in Telegram to verify the bot is running:

!!! untether "Untether"
    pong — up 3d 14h 22m

The response includes the bot's uptime since last restart. Use this as a quick liveness check.

If triggers (crons or webhooks) target the current chat, `/ping` also shows a trigger summary:

!!! untether "Untether"
    pong — up 3d 14h 22m
    ⏰ triggers: 1 cron (daily-review, 9:00 AM daily (Melbourne)), 1 webhook

If [webhooks and cron](webhooks-and-cron.md) are enabled, the webhook server also exposes a health endpoint:

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:9876/health
```

Returns `{"status": "ok", "webhooks": N}` where N is the number of configured webhooks. Useful for external monitoring tools.

### Health snapshot

`/health` immediately replies with an HTML service summary, then edits that same message after bounded, independent process, system, and usage collectors finish. It includes active and queued run counts plus trigger state; the detailed result always retains Service, Process, System, Usage, and Diagnostics sections.

Any unavailable or timed-out collector is marked in its own section without preventing the other diagnostics from rendering. This is expected on Windows for Linux `/proc` system data. If the initial Telegram send or detail edit fails, Untether does not emit a second error message.

The webhook health endpoint remains available for external monitoring:

```
GET http://127.0.0.1:9876/health
```

It returns `{"status": "ok", "webhooks": N}` when the webhook service is enabled.

For Claude subscription diagnostics, use `/usage debug` ([#410](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/410)) — it appends a `🔧 debug` block to the standard `/usage` output showing last-fetch wall time and freshness, last-error class+message, OAuth token expiry, and the cumulative `claude_usage.schema_mismatch` counter. See [Subscription usage](subscription-usage.md#debug-page-usage-debug).

## RAM guard (#350)

Untether refuses to spawn a new engine subprocess when free RAM is below `[watchdog] prespawn_ram_block_mb` (default 500 MB), and warns at `prespawn_ram_warn_mb` (default 2000 MB). On block the run completes early with `🛑 Insufficient RAM` instead of spawning a doomed subprocess that would leak memory under OOM. Set either threshold to `0` to disable that tier; `0 / 0` disables the guard entirely. See [config: `[watchdog]`](../reference/config.md#watchdog).

## Graceful restart

Send `/restart` in Telegram to initiate a graceful shutdown:

1. Untether stops accepting new runs
2. Active runs are drained (allowed to finish)
3. The process exits cleanly
4. Run `untether` again in your terminal (or your process supervisor restarts it automatically)

!!! tip "Prefer /restart over killing the process"
    `/restart` lets in-progress runs complete before shutting down. Killing the process with `kill` or `systemctl restart` may interrupt active runs and lose work.

## SIGTERM behaviour

Sending SIGTERM to the Untether process triggers the same graceful drain as `/restart`:

1. New runs are rejected
2. Active runs are allowed to complete
3. After a 120-second drain timeout, remaining runs are cancelled and the process exits

This means `systemctl --user stop untether` (Linux) also drains gracefully, as systemd sends SIGTERM first. Pressing Ctrl+C in a terminal sends SIGINT, which triggers the same graceful drain.

### Message continuity across restarts

Untether persists the last Telegram `update_id` to `last_update_id.json` in the config directory. On startup, polling resumes from the saved offset — no messages are dropped or re-processed within Telegram's 24-hour retention window. Pending `/at` delays are cancelled during drain and not persisted (they are lost on restart).

!!! note "Drain timeout"
    The default drain timeout is 120 seconds. If active runs don't complete within this window, they are cancelled and a timeout notification is sent to Telegram.

## Orphan progress cleanup

When Untether restarts (after a crash, upgrade, or manual restart), any progress messages from the previous instance are still visible in Telegram — stuck showing "working" with stale elapsed time.

Untether automatically handles this: active progress messages are tracked in `active_progress.json` in the config directory. On startup, any orphan messages from a prior instance are edited to show:

!!! untether "Untether"
    ⚠️ interrupted by restart

This replaces the stale progress text and removes any inline keyboards (approval buttons), so there's no confusion about which messages are from the current session.

The cleanup happens before the startup message is sent, so by the time you see "Untether started", all orphan messages are already resolved.

<!-- TODO: capture screenshot: orphan-cleanup — progress message showing "interrupted by restart" -->

## Systemd service (Linux)

The recommended systemd unit file is provided at `contrib/untether.service`. Key settings:

| Setting | Value | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|
| `Type=notify` | — | Untether sends `READY=1` after startup completes; systemd knows the service is ready |
| `NotifyAccess=main` | — | Only the main process can send sd_notify signals |
| `RestartSec=2` | — | Wait 2 seconds before auto-restarting on failure |
| `OOMScoreAdjust=-100` | — | Makes Untether less likely to be OOM-killed than default processes |
| `OOMPolicy=continue` | — | Don't stop the service if a child process is OOM-killed |
| `KillMode=mixed` | — | Sends SIGTERM to main process, SIGKILL to remaining children after timeout |

Copy the unit file and reload:

```bash
cp contrib/untether.service ~/.config/systemd/user/untether.service
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now untether
```

See the [dev instance reference](../reference/dev-instance.md) for full service file documentation.

## Auto-continue (Claude Code)

When Claude Code exits after receiving tool results without processing them (an upstream bug), Untether detects the premature exit and automatically resumes the session. You'll see a "⚠️ Auto-continuing" notification in the chat.

Auto-continue is enabled by default. It is suppressed for signal deaths (SIGTERM, SIGKILL) to prevent death spirals under memory pressure.

Configure via `[auto_continue]` in `untether.toml`:

| Key | Default | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
| `enabled` | `true` | Enable automatic session resumption. |
| `max_retries` | `1` | Maximum consecutive retries per run (1–5). |

See [troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md#claude-code-exits-without-finishing-auto-continue) for details on when this triggers and how to tune it.

## Run diagnostics

Run the built-in preflight check to validate your configuration:

```sh
untether doctor
```

This validates:

- Telegram bot token is valid and the bot is reachable
- Chat ID is correct and the bot can send messages
- Topics configuration (if enabled)
- File transfer permissions and deny globs
- Voice transcription setup
- Engine availability (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Gemini CLI, Amp)

Run this after any config change, after upgrading, or when something isn't working.

## Debug mode

Start Untether with debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```sh
untether --debug
```

This logs detailed information to `debug.log`, including:

- Engine JSONL events (every line from the subprocess)
- Telegram API requests and responses
- Rendered messages and inline keyboards
- Config loading and validation

!!! tip "Check debug.log first"
    When reporting issues, include the relevant section of `debug.log`. It contains everything needed to diagnose most problems.

## Config hot-reload

Enable config watching so Untether picks up changes without a restart:

=== "untether config"

    ```sh
    untether config set watch_config true
    ```

=== "toml"

    ```toml title="~/.untether/untether.toml"
    watch_config = true
    ```

When enabled, Untether watches the config file for changes and reloads most settings automatically.

**Hot-reloadable** (applied immediately):

- Trigger system: `triggers.enabled`, crons, webhooks, auth, rate limits, timezones
- Telegram bridge: `voice_transcription`, `[files]`, `allowed_user_ids`, `allow_any_user`, `show_resume_line`, timing
- `[security]` keys: `env_extra_allow`, `env_extra_prefix_allow` (re-read on next runner spawn)
- `[progress]` keys: `max_actions`, `verbosity`, `min_render_interval`, `group_chat_rps`, `heartbeat_interval` ([#269](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/269), [#481](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/481))
- `[watchdog]` keys: `tool_timeout`, `mcp_tool_timeout`, `claude_stream_idle_timeout_ms`, `post_result_idle_timeout`, `post_result_idle_enabled`, `bash_grace_seconds` (re-read per run)
- Trigger pause/resume: in-memory only, toggled via `/config → 📡 Triggers` ([#294](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/294)) — restart auto-resumes
- `[footer]` and `[cost]` settings (re-read per call)
- Engine defaults, budget, cost/usage display flags

**Restart-only** (require `/restart` or `systemctl restart`):

- `bot_token`, `chat_id` (Telegram connectivity)
- `session_mode`, `topics.enabled` (structural)
- `message_overflow` (message splitting strategy)

## Process management

=== "Telegram (all platforms)"

    Send `/restart` in Telegram for a graceful restart with drain visibility.
    Use `/ping` to check the bot is running.

=== "Terminal (all platforms)"

    Stop with Ctrl+C (if running), then:

    ```sh
    untether
    ```

    View output directly in the terminal. Use `--debug` for verbose logging to `debug.log`.

=== "Linux (systemd)"

    ```bash
    systemctl --user restart untether
    journalctl --user -u untether -f       # live logs
    systemctl --user status untether       # check status
    journalctl --user -u untether -n 100   # recent logs
    ```

!!! warning "Restart vs /restart"
    `systemctl --user restart untether` sends SIGTERM, which triggers a graceful drain. However, `/restart` in Telegram gives you a confirmation message and visibility into the drain process. Prefer `/restart` when you have Telegram access — it works on all platforms.
