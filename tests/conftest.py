    of the ~220 unfixtured tests that reach ``handle_message`` would lazily
    materialise the real ``~/.untether/session_quarantine.json`` — and
    ``QuarantineStore.load()``'s prune-then-flush can silently REWRITE that
    production file from a pytest run once fleet markers exist and age past
    the 7-day prune window. Inject a fresh, isolated store for every test so
    the singleton never touches disk outside ``tmp_path``.

    Tests with their own local ``quarantine_store`` fixture (test_exec_
    bridge.py, test_loop_coverage.py, test_claude_runner.py) call
    ``set_quarantine_store(...)`` themselves within the test body / their
    own fixture; that call simply overrides this one for the duration of
    the test — fixture setup order (autouse fixtures of the same scope run
    before explicitly-requested ones) guarantees the local override always
    wins, and a redundant ``set_quarantine_store(None)`` in this fixture's
    teardown after a local fixture already reset it is harmless.
