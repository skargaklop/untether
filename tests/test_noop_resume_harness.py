"""End-to-end reproduction harness for the no-op empty-resume bug (#634, W6a).

Spawns a REAL ``untether.runners.claude.ClaudeRunner`` subprocess against the
deterministic fake CLI at ``tests/fake_clis/fake_claude_noop_resume.py``,
driven through the real ``untether.runner_bridge.handle_message`` bridge —
proving the whole pipeline (spawn -> stream-json parse -> anomaly detection
-> fresh recovery) against production-shaped JSONL, deterministically and
without a real Anthropic API call.

Reused/adapted from the sketch in
``docs/plans/2026-07-16-noop-resume-remediation/04-test-strategy.md``,
"Layer 1 -- Fake-claude reproduction harness".

In-process unit coverage for the W1 quarantine-and-fresh recovery itself
(using ``MockRunner``/``ScriptRunner``) already lives in
``tests/test_exec_bridge.py`` (the ``test_631_*`` / ``test_596_*`` tests).
This file's job is narrower and different: prove the REAL ``ClaudeRunner``
(argv construction, subprocess spawn, PTY stdin, msgspec stream-json
decoding, event translation) round-trips correctly into that same recovery
logic when driven against a scripted CLI double, not a Python-level fake
runner.
