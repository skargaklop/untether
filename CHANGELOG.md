# changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.35.5 (2026-08-11)

### fixes

- **windows:** publish the platform-safe lockfile implementation so installed Windows clients no longer import `fcntl` unconditionally. [#459]
- **telegram:** load and dispatch the installed `/health` backend generically, expose catalog misses, and send an immediate health summary before bounded same-message diagnostic detail. [#348]

### changes

- **telegram:** add configured Groq and local AVT voice transcription backends with hot reload, bounded subprocess output, and termination escalation. [#348]
- **stats:** record statistics only for successfully delivered completed runs. [#348]

### tests

- **tests:** cover installed health command discovery, generic unavailable-command delivery, immutable health status, progressive HTML delivery, and `/pi` directive resolution. [#348]

### docs

- **docs:** document progressive `/health` behavior and reconcile the migration audit with deterministic health evidence. [#348]

### changes

- **telegram:** compact and handoff now use authorization-scoped five-minute confirmation cards, one-card lifecycle updates, safe cancellation, and transactional routing that changes a session only after its destination seed completes. [#348]
- **directives:** add sticky `/plan` and `/subagent` preferences, dual-mode `/plan`/`/goal` classification, and native Claude/OpenCode `--agent` support while retaining one-shot skill data. [#348]
- **runners:** apply lifecycle timeout/tree-cleanup settings to subprocess and ACP paths, distinguish JSONL timeouts from EOF, sanitize exhausted transient failures, and seed Pi goal-list sessions when the extension is installed. [#348]
- **ci:** make formatting, Ruff, and zero-diagnostic `ty check src tests` mandatory on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows; retain branch coverage as the Linux source of truth. [#348]

## v0.35.4 (2026-07-22)

<!-- Covers rc1 through rc14 (the full v0.35.4 release-candidate cycle). Date is the
     finalisation date; adjust if the dev→master release merge slips to another day. -->
<!-- NB: rc8's TestPyPI publish was a silent no-op (version unchanged → skip-existing
     swallowed the 400). Everything in the rc8 commits first executed on fleet hosts
     as rc9 — do not claim "verified in rc8" anywhere. -->

### fixes

- **fix(telegram):** stop the spurious `transport.edit.failed error=None` warning that fired after every answered AskUserQuestion. The keyboard-clear edit is coalesced out of the outbox by a concurrent same-message progress edit; the losing op was resolved to `None`, indistinguishable at the `edit()` layer from a real `editMessageText` failure — which is also why PR #608's HTTP-layer error capture never populated it (a superseded op never makes an HTTP call, so there is no api_error to record). Edit ops now opt into a `SUPERSEDED` outbox disposition threaded through all three intentional-drop paths (same-key supersede, `drop_pending` ahead of a delete/replace, and a `RetryAfter` requeue collision); the transport treats it as a benign `transport.edit.superseded` no-op and returns the ref instead of logging a failure. Send/delete ops keep the `None` failure contract (the sentinel is opt-in per op, so a superseded replace-send can never be misread as a sent message). Root-caused with gpt-5.6-sol. 5 new tests across `tests/test_telegram_queue.py` and `tests/test_telegram_bridge.py` [#598](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/598)
- **fix(pi):** surface Pi stderr and diagnose silent `rc=0` no-`agent_end` exits. Untether was blind to *why* Pi exited on the stream-end fallback path — the hardcoded "pi finished without an agent_end event" message hid both the failure category and Pi's own stderr (this is what made the original "resume is broken" report so hard to diagnose; the real cause was a transient MCP-cold startup crash, not a resume-token bug — fix options A/B/C from the original issue were explicitly NOT implemented). `stream_end_events` now distinguishes a zero-translated-events startup/early-exit crash (with a "session may have failed to load on resume" hint on resumed runs) from a genuinely truncated stream, appends a sanitised tail of captured stderr, and logs `had_events`/`resumed` fields on `pi.stream.no_agent_end` so the issue-watcher can promote resumed failures to error tier. `stderr_lines` threaded through the polymorphic `stream_end_events` (base + all 6 runners). Follow-ups (out of repo / separate): error-tier promotion in `untether-issue-watcher`; a real 2-turn context-retention integration test (historically U4 only checked a filesystem side-effect). 4 new tests in `tests/test_pi_runner.py` [#565](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/565)
- **fix(pi):** wire `auto_retry_start` / `auto_retry_end` events. They were schema-defined but never translated, so transient provider retries were invisible in Telegram and starved the liveness watchdog of event activity during backoff. They now render as `note` actions ("retrying provider (attempt N/M, ~Xs delay)" → "retry succeeded" / "retry exhausted: …") with a stable `retry_N` action id across the start/end pair. A dedicated stall-watchdog "retry-in-progress is CPU-active" suppression branch is deferred (provider delays sit well under the stall threshold and the translated events already refresh the idle timer). 5 new tests in `tests/test_pi_runner.py`; docs §4.6 in `docs/reference/runners/pi/untether-events.md` [#460](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/460)
- **fix(claude):** clear a background-task handle only on a *terminal* tool_result, not the first one. A long-running Monitor streams multiple interim tool_results; clearing `live_monitors` on the first dropped the `stall_monitor_active_suppressed` branch, so spurious stall warnings rose again while the Monitor was legitimately running. New `_is_terminal_tool_result` + an `is_terminal` gate on `_clear_background_handle`: a Monitor with a live deadline keeps its handle through interim stdout lines, clearing only on an error result or once its own `timeout_ms` deadline passes (the result text is arbitrary command stdout, so it is deliberately NOT scanned for "completed"/"done" markers — that would false-clear on a build printing "Done"; the deadline in `has_live_background_work` is the reliable, bounded backstop, so no leak). All other primitives (Bash-bg / Agent-bg / ScheduleWakeup / RemoteTrigger) keep the pre-existing clear-on-result behaviour. Full terminal-detection for those (KillShell, subprocess exit, deadline sweeps) is the v0.35.5 lifecycle refactor — doing it here without that infrastructure would risk the inverse failure (a handle that never clears, wedging the post-result idle watchdog). 5 new/updated tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py`. rc7 extended the same bounded-keep pattern to `Agent`/`Task` via `bg_agent_deadlines` + `BG_AGENT_MAX_KEEP_S` (15 min) and recognised `Task` as a background primitive; Bash-bg, ScheduleWakeup and RemoteTrigger terminal-detection remain deferred to [#573](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/573) [#374](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/374)
- **security:** SSRF-validate `voice_transcription_base_url` before any outbound transcription call (Telegram audit 2026-04-20 §SSRF). A misconfigured or filesystem-edited base URL could exfiltrate voice audio to an internal service. The existing `triggers/ssrf.py:validate_url_with_dns` validator is now applied at the `transcribe_voice` chokepoint (async, DNS-aware), with a sync `validate_url` fast-fail at config load for obvious cases (non-http scheme, private-IP literal). New optional `[transports.telegram] voice_transcription_url_allowlist` (CIDR/IP strings) opts in to private endpoints such as an Azure private-link range. Skipped when `base_url` is unset (the default public `api.openai.com` path). [#381](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/381)
- **security:** refuse to bind the webhook server when any webhook has `auth = "none"` on a non-loopback host (Telegram audit 2026-04-20 §ASI07). An unauthenticated webhook on a public interface is a remote-agent-run primitive. The initial-bind guard (`run_webhook_server`) and the hot-reload path (`TriggerManager.update`) both refuse/drop such routes while leaving polling, commands, and crons running. Opt in for local demos with `[triggers] allow_unauthenticated_webhooks = true`. [#382](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/382)
- **lockfile:** replace the `os.kill(pid, 0)` liveness check with an `fcntl.flock(2)` advisory lock so a reused PID can no longer make a stale lock look valid forever — the bug crash-restart-looped services indefinitely (hit twice in 24h on lba-1, once via a cross-project collision with `qdrant`). The kernel releases the lock automatically on process death, so manual `rm` recovery is no longer needed; the lock fd is held for the process lifetime and stays non-inheritable so it can't leak into spawned engine subprocesses. [#459](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/459)
- **release:** push the auto-created `vX.Y.Z` tag with a dedicated `RELEASE_TAG_PAT` secret instead of the workflow `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so the tag push actually triggers `release.yml` (GitHub suppresses downstream workflow runs for `GITHUB_TOKEN`-triggered events, which forced a manual `gh workflow run` on every release). Restores the unattended single-gate flow. Requires a one-time fine-scoped `RELEASE_TAG_PAT` secret (`contents: write`) and removal of the now-redundant `pypi` environment reviewer. [#376](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/376)
- **fix(claude):** actually reap the leaked MCP `node` children the earlier sweep (PR #605) still missed. Fleet audit found `dembrandt-mcp` on nsd leaking one child per run — it `setpgid`s into its own process group (distinct PGID, still in Claude's session) so `killpg(claude_pgid)` structurally can't reach it, and the fallback descendant-PID snapshot was never populated on a fast clean rc=0 run (the reader-done capture is gated on `proc.returncode is None`, which fails once the leader exits, and the limbo capture never fires and used direct-children-only). New `_capture_orphan_descendants` captures the recursive descendant tree at the **result event** — the one point where the CLI is guaranteed alive with every MCP child spawned — plus fixes the limbo capture to walk recursively; the post-exit sweep then reaches pgroup escapees by recorded PID. Hardened against PID reuse with a `/proc` starttime birth-identity token (`pid_starttime`) verified before each signal, so a recycled PID is never killed. 4 new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py`, 3 in `tests/test_subprocess.py`, 3 in `tests/test_proc_diag.py` [#590](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/590)
- **fix(bridge):** auto-resend once on an empty-result no-op resume instead of leaving the user to re-nudge manually. Resuming a session whose prior turn ended on a tool_result can make the CLI return an immediate 0-turn/$0/empty completion; the surfacing note (PR #606) told the user to resend, but Untether now resends the original prompt automatically against the same session (single-shot, guarded by `_empty_resent_count`, mutually exclusive with auto-continue). A "↻ retrying automatically…" notice is shown early. Opt-out via `[auto_continue] resend_empty_resume = false`. 4 new + 1 updated tests in `tests/test_exec_bridge.py` [#596](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/596)
- **fix(telegram):** stop re-scanning/re-logging stale outbox directories on every run. Skipped directories (an agent that wrote e.g. `screenshots/` into `.untether-outbox/`) are now moved once to `.untether-outbox/.skipped/` (collision-suffixed) and the skip notice tells the user where they went; the graveyard is excluded from future scans, and an outbox containing ONLY a directory now reaches cleanup. Verified live on the fleet. 7 tests in `tests/test_outbox_delivery.py` [#600](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/600)
- **fix(claude):** deliver the final answer the moment a successful result arrives instead of waiting for the subprocess to exit. A run holding lingering MCP children blocked delivery for up to the full 600s post-result watchdog, and one answer was lost entirely when the user `/cancel`'d a run that had already completed. Adds `[watchdog] post_result_limbo_grace` (default 60s, 0=off) so a fully-quiescent limbo subprocess is SIGTERMed after the grace instead of the full timeout. Verified on `@untether_dev_bot`: answer delivered 23s before subprocess exit [#591](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/591)
- **fix(claude):** bound the pre-result watchdog dead zone with a new `[watchdog] pre_result_silence_timeout` (default 3600s, 0=off). A run whose stream went silent before its first result was previously unbounded — an 8-day zombie Claude subprocess on mac leaked its session lock and MCP children. Suppressed while permission/ask requests are pending so plan-approval waits stay safe [#592](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/592)
- **fix(watchdog):** enforce teardown on stall auto-cancel and thread the spawn PID into stall diagnostics. `ClaudeRunner.run_impl` now sets `last_pid`, and auto-cancel polls 30s for natural death before killing the subprocess directly (descendant-aware) — a post-OOM zombie previously lingered 14m52s after the cancel decision. rc10 added `last_seen_alive_s` to `stall_detected` / `stall_auto_cancel`, since all liveness fields collapse to `None` once the process is gone, which invites the "PID was never threaded" misdiagnosis. Fleet-verified: zero `pid=None` occurrences across 16 sessions, decision-to-reap 10.0s versus the originally reported 14m52s [#593](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/593)
- **fix(runners):** release the asyncio subprocess transport at run end. `manage_subprocess` now awaits `proc.aclose()` on every exit path (all 6 engines covered from one point), replacing the `RuntimeError: Event loop is closed` tracebacks raised from `BaseSubprocessTransport.__del__` at interpreter shutdown [#599](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/599)
- **fix(claude):** stop `catalog_staleness.detected` flooding journals — ~2,930 WARNINGs per 48h fleet-wide, 96% of one host's total warnings. `status=pending` at `system.init` is a startup race and now logs INFO with per-run dedup; `needs-auth` / `failed` keep WARNING but dedup across runs via a process-lifetime `(server, status)` registry instead of resetting on every subprocess spawn [#595](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/595)
- **fix(claude):** accept `image` and `document` content blocks in the stream schema. Reading binary media echoed them inside user-role messages and msgspec dropped the whole line as `jsonl.msgspec.invalid` [#597](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/597)
- **fix(telegram):** surface the failure reason in `transport.edit.failed`. The Telegram description was previously only visible in a separate, uncorrelated `telegram.api_error` line; it is now recorded per method/chat/message at the client layer on every failure path. "Message is not modified" is normalised to an info-level `transport.edit.noop` returning the original ref — the edit's intent is already satisfied, so it must not read as a failure [#598](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/598)
- **fix(telegram):** report cron counts consistently at startup. `triggers.enabled` now logs `crons=<active>` (agreeing with `triggers.manager.updated` and `triggers.cron.started`) plus `crons_configured=<raw TOML entries>`; the raw count previously read as "N crons failed to load" during triage when the delta was just spent `run_once` entries [#601](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/601)
- **fix(voice):** harden transcription against transient provider blips. Widens `AsyncOpenAI` retries 2→4 so a sub-15s connection blip self-heals before reaching the user, replaces the opaque "Connection error." with an actionable hint for `APIConnectionError` / `APITimeoutError`, and fixes an unreachable `TimeoutError` branch shadowed by `OSError` [#584](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/584)
- **fix(voice):** make transcription failures diagnosable. `openai.transcribe.error` now logs the resolved endpoint and the exception `__cause__`, and `voice_transcription_api_key` is validated at config load — control characters (an embedded newline from concatenated key material) and non-latin-1 characters are rejected with a `ConfigError` instead of surfacing hours later as a connection error on every voice note [#594](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/594)
- **fix(bridge):** close the runner generator in the pump task and shield early final delivery, so a final message already in flight is not lost when the run tears down [#614](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/614)
- **fix(bridge):** raise the delivery shield bound from 15s to 60s so multi-chunk final messages complete before the shield expires [#618](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/618)
- **fix(claude):** quarantine poisoned sessions instead of resuming them, and recover on a fresh session. An upstream background-subagent/message-queue defect (reproduced on CLI 2.1.211) leaves the last turn dangling on an unresolved `tool_use` when the lingering post-result process is SIGTERM'd; the next `--resume` then returns 0 turns / $0 / an empty answer with `rc=0` — a silent failure the user only sees as "nothing happened". New persistent `QuarantineStore` (`session_quarantine.py`, JSON sibling to `untether.toml`, survives restart, 7-day prune) marks such sessions so they are never resumed, and the original message is auto-resent once against a fresh session. Structured event chain: `runner.empty_result` → `session.quarantined` → `session.auto_resend_fresh` / `session.resume_diverted_fresh`. Hardened against malformed timestamps, non-dict JSON, and partial writes. Opt out via `[auto_continue] empty_resume_fresh = false`. Claude runner only [#631](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/631)
- **fix(claude):** quarantine proactively on `forced_teardown_after_result` rather than waiting to observe an empty result. A session SIGTERM'd after delivering its result may already have a dangling turn upstream, so the next message diverts to a fresh session *before* any empty resume is seen — turning a silent amnesia event into a deliberate, announced one. Opt out via `[auto_continue] quarantine_on_forced_teardown = false` [#632](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/632)
- **fix(claude):** age out background-task handles so a single stale entry can't wedge the post-result watchdog. `live_bg_bashes` and `live_remote_triggers` had no deadline at all, so one entry made `has_live_background_work()` return True for the rest of the run — suppressing the post-result watchdog and leaving the process lingering in limbo, precisely the state that gets SIGTERM'd and poisons the session. The missing age-out was feeding the empty-resume defect this whole milestone is about. Both now carry parallel deadline maps following the rc7 bg-agent pattern, and `_live_bounded_handle_count` generalises `_live_bg_agent_count` so the expiry rule lives in one place. Ceilings are deliberately generous (1h) — this is a last-resort backstop, not a prediction [#573](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/573)
- **fix(watchdog):** stop the stall detector false-alarming on sessions parked on an unanswered approval. A 5h session waiting on an ExitPlanMode approval emitted 88 `progress_edits.stall_detected` WARNs and 2 `frozen_ring_escalation` WARNs — while completing successfully. `_has_pending_approval()` inferred approval state from *presentation* data (the latest action's `inline_keyboard` detail), which an ExitPlanMode permission request does not carry; its watchdog-side twin `_recent_event_is_control_request` reads the newest ring-buffer entry, which after hours of waiting is a stale user/result frame. Both are "most recent thing" heuristics and both go stale. Switched to the authoritative signal — `_REQUEST_TO_SESSION`, populated on interception and popped on answer — exposed as `ClaudeStreamState.awaiting_user_approval()` and reached from the engine-agnostic bridge by the same `engine_state` duck-typing already used for `has_live_background_work`, so other engines degrade to False. Two non-obvious follow-on fixes were required: the frozen-ring counter is now **held at zero** for the duration of an expected wait (an approval wait produces no JSONL by definition, so it climbed past every suppressor sitting behind `if not frozen_escalate`; merely skipping the escalation would leave an inflated counter that trips the instant the user clicks Approve), and `_total_stall_warn_count` moved behind a single `_count_stall_warning()` helper called only where a WARNING is actually emitted, so the metric means what its name says. The `process_dead` auto-cancel safety valve is unchanged and still checked first. 6 new tests [#495](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/495) [#499](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/499) [#500](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/500)
- **fix(claude):** accept the new `tool_progress` heartbeat event. Claude Code emits a top-level `tool_progress` frame while a long-running tool is in flight; msgspec rejected the unknown tag and dropped the line with `jsonl.msgspec.invalid` (275 rejects in a 24h fleet window). Reproduced on CLI 2.1.214 with a >30s Bash command and the exact shape captured (a `-heartbeat-N` suffixed `tool_use_id` plus `tool_name` / `elapsed_time_seconds` / `heartbeat`). Added a permissive `StreamToolProgressMessage` to the top-level union following the #489/#597 precedent — no runner change needed, `translate`'s fallback already ignores unrecognised events. Untether renders its own elapsed-time tail (#481), so the upstream heartbeat is redundant for progress; the schema entry just stops the line being dropped. Fleet-verified: 275 rejections in the pre-fix 24h baseline → 0 across 4 runs / ~80 tool actions. 3 new tests [#637](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/637)
- **fix(claude):** make auto-continue's signal-death suppression actually work. `stream.proc_returncode` is assigned only in the base runner, but `ClaudeRunner` overrides `run_impl` wholesale and never wrote it back — so the bridge always saw `None`, `_is_signal_death(None)` returned False, and the death-spiral guard that #589's OOM analysis depended on did not exist in practice, for the only engine auto-continue applies to. Fleet evidence (nsd, 14 days) correlating each `session.auto_continue` with the preceding `subprocess.exit`: `{rc=0: 47, rc=143: 2}` — two auto-continues fired straight after a SIGTERM. Fixed the assignment and tightened the gate to require `rc=0` (the docstring always claimed the upstream bug exits cleanly, but only signal deaths were excluded); zero real events fall in the 1..128 range, so narrowing costs no genuine recovery, and `rc=None` stays eligible as a fail-open. One existing test asserting the pre-fix behaviour was inverted with the fleet evidence recorded. 8 new rc-gate table tests [#640](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/640)
- **fix:** guard against the OOM killer with concurrency-aware pre-spawn accounting. The nsd OOM killer struck `untether.service` five times in one evening, killing two live Claude runs with `rc=-9`, each holding 10–17 MCP node children. The existing #350 pre-spawn RAM guard is per-spawn and count-blind: N chats each pass the free-RAM check independently, then collectively exhaust the host. New `live_engine_subprocess_count()` is instrumented in `manage_subprocess` — the single spawn point every runner shares — counted there rather than from `TelegramLoopState.running_tasks` because what consumes memory is a live subprocess, not a queued task, and floored at zero so an unbalanced decrement can't permanently disable the guard. `prespawn_ram_per_run_reserve_mb` (default 750) scales the block threshold with concurrency, and `max_concurrent_engine_runs` (default 0 = unlimited) is a hard ceiling. Preferred over the cgroup limits because it fails a run with a readable Telegram message instead of letting the kernel SIGKILL a live session mid-task; the systemd half already existed but was commented out with no guidance, and now carries a host-RAM sizing table pointing at the in-app knobs as the primary mitigation [#589](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/589)
- **fix(claude):** serialise session ownership so two subprocesses can never hold one session id — prevention, where #631/#632 are recovery. A follow-up message could spawn `--resume <sid>` while the previous subprocess for that session was still alive in post-result limbo (reproductions show a resume 6s after the prior process was SIGTERM'd) — exactly the condition that leaves the upstream turn dangling. New `wait_for_session_handoff(sid, timeout_s)` returns `free` / `exited` / `timed_out`, condition-based so the common case costs one dict lookup; liveness reuses the existing `is_session_alive` / `_SESSION_STDIN` registries (`SessionLockMixin.session_locks` cannot serve — it's a `WeakValueDictionary`). The gate lives in the bridge alongside the quarantine-divert block so it applies uniformly to recursive auto-continue / auto-resend re-entries. Four corrections from adversarial review: fail **closed** on a probe exception (divert fresh, WARN), do **not** quarantine on timeout (busy ≠ corrupt — a 7-day marker is far too destructive), a final liveness probe after the loop so polling granularity doesn't mislabel an exited owner, and an explicit regression test proving auto-continue re-entry doesn't burn the full budget. Config: `[auto_continue] serialize_session_owner` (default true), `session_handoff_timeout_s` (default 30, bounded 0–300). 11 new tests [#633](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/633)
- **fix(claude):** register subagents that run in the background *by default*. Claude Code has run subagents in the background by default since v2.1.198 — the tool contract reads "Subagents run in the background by default; pass `run_in_background: false` for a synchronous run" — so the flag is normally **absent** from the Agent/Task input. `_register_background_handle` gated on `bool(raw_input.get("run_in_background"))`, reading omission as *foreground*, and therefore never registered a real subagent. Measured on nsd: 11/11 Agent calls across the 5 quarantined sessions omit the key. Failure chain: no handle → `has_live_background_work()` False → the post-result watchdog applies the 60s limbo grace instead of the 600s timeout → SIGTERM of a subprocess whose subagents are still working → quarantine on `forced_teardown_after_result` → the user's next message diverts to a fresh, contextless session. New `_agent_runs_in_background()` treats a call as background unless the caller explicitly opted out with literal `False`; over-registering is the safe direction (bounded by the 600s ceiling and the 900s `BG_AGENT_MAX_KEEP_S` age-out), while under-registering force-kills live work and poisons the session. Bash is deliberately untouched — its `run_in_background` flag is genuinely opt-in upstream. Verified live with 3 background subagents: passed through limbo untouched, exited naturally `rc=0`, no quarantine, follow-up resumed the same session [#646](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/646)
- **fix(watchdog):** stop alarming the user after a run has already delivered successfully. A run that had posted its final answer with `✓ turn complete` received a user-facing "Auto-cancelled: session appears stuck (process_dead)" 6m51s later — nothing was lost, but the notice was pure noise. The `process_dead` auto-cancel arm now checks `stream.did_emit_completed` first: a dead subprocess whose run already emitted its `CompletedEvent` is a normally-completed run being reaped late (the detector was racing the subcountdown's returncode poll), so it is reaped through the same cancel machinery but **silently** — INFO `progress_edits.reaped_after_delivery`, no WARN, no notice. The gate is directional and regression-locked: a dead process on a run that never completed still alarms. #614 made the user-initiated cancelled-after-delivery path quiet; this makes the watchdog-initiated variant actually quiet too. Also closes the ~6-minute observability blackout between the one-shot `limbo_detected` warning and loop exit with a periodic `subcountdown_tick` INFO (~30s, tunable). 2 new tests [#650](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/650)
- **fix(claude):** stop the 600s post-result ceiling killing live subagent work, and announce every fresh-session divert. The subcountdown deadline is now liveness-aware: while `has_live_background_work()` is true and `/proc` evidence does not show the tree demonstrably idle, the SIGTERM is deferred and re-checked each poll. Bounded twice — background handles age out at `BG_AGENT_MAX_KEEP_S`, and the hold never exceeds `[watchdog] post_result_bg_max_hold` (default 1800s, 0 disables). Upstream runs subagents in the background by default since Claude Code v2.1.198 and never signals their completion on stream-json, so `/proc` is the only available evidence. On the handoff side: `wait_for_session_handoff` now logs entry and exit (the wait could previously absorb minutes with no journal trace at all); when the base 30s wait times out and the owner has live background work (new `_SESSION_BG_STATE` registry + `session_live_bg_count()`), the user is told why the reply is delayed and the wait extends, bounded by new `[auto_continue] session_handoff_bg_timeout_s` (default 600s). Every fresh-session divert is now announced — `handoff_timeout`, entry-time quarantine, and the new `quarantined_during_handoff` re-check, which matters because the ceiling can quarantine the owner while the handoff wait is in flight and resuming it would poison the next turn. `sigterm_after_timeout` gained `live_background_work` / `bg_hold_extended` / `cpu_active` / `tree_active` so the "tracked and killed anyway" cohort is identifiable regardless of which divert label lands. 8 new tests [#647](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/647)
- **fix(claude):** don't apply the 60s limbo grace to a demonstrably busy post-result process. The #591 limbo-grace cap gated only on `not live_bg` — the absence of a *registered* background handle — while its comment claimed "fully quiescent". A CPU-active, tree-active process with no registered handle was therefore misclassified as idle, SIGTERM'd at 60s, quarantined, and diverted to a fresh contextless session; one observed case lost the full context of a 23m52s / 38-step turn, killed 70s after delivering its result while doing exactly what it had told the user it would do. Not a regression — an incomplete fix: rc10 introduced `is_cpu_active` / `is_tree_cpu_active` but wired them into only one of the two gates, giving the extension gate a `demonstrably_idle` veto with no symmetric `demonstrably_busy` veto on the grace cap. The cap now computes `demonstrably_busy = cpu_active is True or tree_active is True` and applies the grace only when `not live_bg and not demonstrably_busy`. Single-sample CPU flapping (latching "busy seen recently" over a window) is deliberately deferred pending production evidence. Written TDD — the failing test first — plus a boundary test and an end-to-end test driving a real CPU-busy child through real `/proc` accounting [#655](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/655)
- **fix(claude):** latch a conservative wait on a bare `rate_limit_event`. When every timing field arrives null, the #518 fallback didn't cover the no-field case and `rate_limit_wait_until` stayed unlatched, so a throttled session read as idle to the watchdog and risked being mistaken for hung. A bare event now latches `DEFAULT_BARE_RATE_LIMIT_WAIT_S = 60s` with `retry_after_source="default"`, making `awaiting_rate_limit_retry()` directionally correct, and the estimate surfaces as "waiting to retry (~60s)" [#657](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/657)
- **fix(claude):** let the `ExitPlanMode` plan input satisfy the outline gate. On plan-file CLIs the model writes no chat text at all, so the text-based gate (`max_text_len_since_cooldown < 200`) could never be satisfied and deny-looped until Claude gave up. The `plan` field of the `ExitPlanMode` input now satisfies the gate, and the plan body renders as the standalone outline message with the usual Approve / Deny / Let's discuss buttons [#659](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/659)
- **fix(config):** resolve the engine's real default model on the `/config` Routing line instead of a generic placeholder. `get_engine_default_model()` reads the OpenCode and Pi settings files for the actual configured default; the placeholder hints are kept as a fallback when no settings file is readable [#475](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/475)
- **fix(claude):** capture `proc_returncode` on the cancellation path, not only the happy path (#640 follow-up). #640 mirrored the subprocess return code onto the stream state, but the assignment sits in `run_impl`'s try body right after `await proc.wait()` — so cancellation (`/cancel`, `/new`, drain), an exception in the task group / JSONL reader, or the early pipes `RuntimeError` all skip it and leave `proc_returncode` `None`. On those paths `_is_signal_death(None)` is False and `proc_returncode not in (0, None)` passes `None` through, so the auto-continue death-spiral guard stays inert exactly when a run died messily. `manage_subprocess.__aexit__` already runs a shielded, bounded terminate+reap before `run_impl`'s `finally`, so the code is available there with no extra `wait()`; the capture now happens in the `finally`, guarded for the paths where `proc`/`stream` were never bound. New cancel-mid-flight harness test driving a real `ClaudeRunner` subprocess + a `hang_before_result` fake-CLI scenario [#667](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/667)
- **fix(claude):** make the fail-closed handoff probe attributable and correct a stale settings comment (#633 follow-up). `session.handoff_check_failed` bound only `exc_info=True`, so a persistent probe failure — which silently makes every resume divert fresh, presenting to the user as total loss of conversational continuity — collapsed into one indistinguishable report under the issue-watcher's signature dedup. It now binds `engine` / `session_id` / `chat_id`, matching the sibling `session.handoff` events. Also corrects the `serialize_session_owner` comment in `settings.py`, which still described the abandoned "quarantine on timeout" behaviour: the implementation deliberately diverts fresh WITHOUT quarantining (a busy session is not a known-corrupt one, and a 7-day marker is too destructive), now documented as an intentional deviation from the #633 W4 design. Attribution assertions added to `test_633_probe_failure_fails_closed` [#668](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/668)

### changes

- **shutdown:** shorten the graceful-drain timeout from 120s to 10s when the sole active run is the session that triggered the restart (the #547 self-restart deadlock — `systemctl restart` issued from inside the only active run can never self-complete), and flush queued outbox sends with a bounded 5s window before close so an already-queued final message isn't dropped on the way out (a message the hard-cancelled run never enqueued can't be recovered). `/restart` records the originating chat for the precise case; SIGTERM relies on the `active_runs == 1` heuristic. Follow-up to #547 axis 3. [#559](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/559)
- **feat(telegram):** optionally deliver skipped outbox **directories** as a zip. Agents that emit an image folder (e.g. `/quality` screenshot audits) previously only ever learned the folder was skipped/archived — it never reached Telegram. New `[transports.telegram.files] outbox_deliver_directories = "zip"` (default `"off"`) bundles each skipped directory's deliverable members into a single `<name>.zip` document. Security: recursive `deny_globs` applied to every member (defaults broadened to cover `.env.*`, `*.key`, `id_rsa`/`id_ed25519`, `.netrc`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`), symlinked files and deny-globbed subdirs (`.git`/`.ssh`) pruned, members read through an `O_NOFOLLOW` descriptor with `fstat` validation (closes the stat→write TOCTOU), and per-member / total-input / member-count / traversal / final-zip-size / attachment-count all capped. No deliverable members, an oversize zip, a build error, or a send failure fall back to the #600 archive. Compression runs off the event loop. 8 tests in `tests/test_outbox_delivery.py` [#628](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/628)
- **feat(watchdog):** bounded auto-resume for Type-A stream-idle timeouts. #438 shipped the Type-A / Type-B classification but deferred auto-retry pending upstream Anthropic stabilisation; new `[watchdog] stream_idle_auto_retry` (default **off**) and `stream_idle_max_retries` now auto-resume a mid-generation stream-idle stall a bounded number of times. Type-B (cold-start, zero-byte) is **never** retried — it's an upstream outage, not a local miscalibration — and both signal-death and cost-budget guards apply, so a retry can't spiral under memory pressure or blow a daily budget. Emits a `claude.stream_idle.auto_retry` structured log [#572](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/572)
- **feat(telegram):** new `[transports.telegram] voice_transcription_language` ISO-639-1 hint, passed to the Whisper API `language` parameter. Short utterances were being detected as the wrong language and transcribed accordingly — "Continue" came back as "계속". Validated at config parse time and hot-reloadable with the rest of the bridge settings [#638](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/638)
- **changes(claude):** retire the progressive-cooldown workaround. The 30/60/90/120s escalation existed to absorb Claude Code v2.1.72–2.1.74 re-issuing `ExitPlanMode` immediately after a denial (#126 lineage). Verified fixed upstream on CLI 2.1.215 — a denied `ExitPlanMode` now yields a clean text turn with no re-issue — so `_DISCUSS_COOLDOWN` and its escalation ladder are removed. The text-based outline gate (`mark_outline_pending`) survives and is unaffected. If the upstream loop ever regresses, the repro is: deny an `ExitPlanMode` control_request via the Telegram buttons and watch for an immediate re-issue [#570](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/570)
- **changes(watchdog):** `runner.limbo_detected` now logs at INFO when the same evaluation shows live background work or a busy process tree, reserving WARNING for the genuinely quiescent stuck case. Under rc10's liveness-aware ceiling a healthy long-running session routinely trips this path, so a WARNING was misleading operators and the issue-watcher alike. The event is enriched with `live_background_work` / `cpu_active` / `tree_active` [#653](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/653)
- **feat(telegram):** tell the user why a follow-up is queued. A message arriving behind a lingering post-result Claude session could sit on a bare "queued" for up to 30 minutes with no explanation — one observed case held a voice note for 5m36s in silence. The notice now states the background-task count, that context will carry over, and the `/cancel` hint [#654](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/654)
- **feat(fleet):** `scripts/fleet-status.sh` gives a one-shot read-only version/state view across all 5 hosts, plus rollout attestation guardrails and a `/ping` verification playbook [#627](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/627)
- **feat(scripts):** SHA-bind the integration-test attestation marker. `scripts/run-integration-tests.sh` now records the `head_sha` of the tested commit (auto-derived from the script's repo, overridable via `--head-sha` / `UT_INTEGRATION_HEAD_SHA`) and a `dev_bot_id` (default overridable via `UT_DEV_BOT_ID`) into the marker JSON, so the fleet-rollout gate can bind an attestation to the exact commit being rolled rather than a bare version string; tiers and notes are preserved. 5 tests in `tests/test_attestation_marker.py` [#674](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/674)

### tests

- **tests:** deterministic fault-injection harness for the no-op empty resume. New `tests/fake_clis/fake_claude_noop_resume.py` scenarios drive a real `ClaudeRunner` and `handle_message` through the real spawn / PTY / msgspec pipeline: the quarantine-and-fresh recovery, a healthy-resume negative control, the linger-scenario emission shape, and a `resume_survives_sigterm` leg modelling a prior owner that ignores SIGTERM — asserting the core invariant that exactly **one** spawn occurs and it is the fresh leg, never a `--resume` of a session that still had a live owner. Converts the manual B-RESUME integration procedure into deterministic coverage. Two existing tests that constructed background state by bare set membership (bypassing the registration path) now register deadlines as `_register_background_handle` always does [#634](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/634)
- **tests:** raise the `anyio.fail_after` hang-guards in the `run_main_loop` tests from 2s to 30s. They flaked on cold coverage runs and on loaded CI runners (reproduced on the CI 3.12 runner); the root cause was timing, not test-order state. These guards exist to catch hangs, not to race the loop [#641](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/641)

### docs

- **docs:** codify the post-result watchdog as a permanent mitigation rather than retire-able dead code. Both upstream defects (`claude-code#39700`, `#30333`) are NOT_PLANNED, so the watchdog/SIGTERM path is permanent. Recorded in the Claude runner reference and the config reference, including the constraint that #527's detector refactor must not drop the kill path — the detector decides *messaging*, the watchdog decides *survival* [#569](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/569)
- **docs:** keep auto-continue's #34142 path, documented as symptom-based. Retiring it is not implementable as proposed: `_should_auto_continue` is a single symptom-based predicate, and at the decision point the subprocess has already exited and the two upstream defects are observationally identical (a `result` frame excludes the predicate rather than discriminating between them). `background_observed` correlates with the NOT_PLANNED #30333 but is unsound as a gate — it also fires for Monitor, background Bash, ScheduleWakeup and RemoteTrigger — so gating on it would silently drop recovery for a defect upstream declined to fix. Verdict recorded, plus the cohort markers (`background_observed`, `proc_returncode`, `event_count`) needed before any future narrowing [#568](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/568)
- **docs:** document the `untether-issue-watcher` event set and msgspec dedup signature in `contrib/README-issue-watcher.md`, closing the four monitor `already_tracked` patterns that had no watcher coverage. Adds `jsonl.msgspec.invalid` (per-gap dedup keyed on invalid-value@JSONPath), `progress_edits.stall_auto_cancel`, and `progress_edits.frozen_ring_escalation`; `stall_detected` is deliberately watcher-excluded because the monitor owns it. The daemon script itself is out-of-repo and deployed to all 5 fleet hosts [#639](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/639)

## v0.35.3 (2026-05-20)

### breaking

- **security:** empty `[transports.telegram] allowed_user_ids` is now a startup `ConfigError` instead of a silent insecure default. Previously, an unset or empty allowlist meant any Telegram user who knew the bot username could send commands — a real production-bot footgun. Operators who want an open bot (demos, hackathons, dev) must opt in explicitly with `allow_any_user = true`, which is logged at INFO every boot (`security.allow_any_user`) so the deviation stays visible in `journalctl`. Existing deployments already configured with a populated allowlist are unaffected; deployments running with an empty allowlist will fail to start until the operator either populates the list or sets the opt-out flag. Migration is a one-line config edit. The legacy-config migration in `config_migrations.py` now relocates a top-level `allow_any_user` key into `[transports.telegram]` alongside `bot_token` / `chat_id`. New `_validate_allowed_user_ids_or_optin` `@model_validator` in `TelegramTransportSettings`. 4 new tests in `tests/test_settings.py` (block + opt-out + populated + both-set) [#377](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/377)

### changes

- **feat:** Gemini runner now passes `--skip-trust` by default so headless runs work outside `~/.gemini/trustedFolders.json`. Gemini CLI rejects runs from any directory not in the trust list — even with `--approval-mode yolo` — and there is no interactive prompt path in headless usage, so projects outside the trust list silently failed before any agent output. Untether already runs Gemini with `yolo` for the same "always headless" reason, so passing `--skip-trust` extends the same precedent. `GeminiRunner.skip_trust` (default `True`) is the runtime switch; opt out per deployment with `[gemini] skip_trust = false` in `untether.toml` (security-conscious operators who want Gemini's project-local extension/MCP trust gate enforced). 2 new tests in `tests/test_build_args.py::TestGeminiBuildArgs` (`test_skip_trust_default_includes_flag`, `test_skip_trust_opt_out_omits_flag`) [#471](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/471)
- **feat:** hot-reload `[progress]` settings — editing `[progress].max_actions`, `[progress].verbosity`, `[progress].min_render_interval`, or `[progress].group_chat_rps` in `untether.toml` now applies on the next run without restarting the bot. Companion to the trigger hot-reload (#294) and bridge hot-reload (#286/#318) shipped earlier this milestone. The four settings groups in scope for #269 each had a different starting state: `[footer]` and `[cost]` were already reading fresh per-call from `_load_footer_settings()` / `load_settings_if_exists()` (no work needed); `[watchdog]` was already reading fresh per-run via `_load_watchdog_settings()` at the top of `handle_message` (still no restart-required, just verified); the only gap was `[progress]`, where `MarkdownFormatter(max_actions, verbosity)` and `ExecBridgeConfig.min_render_interval` were baked in at startup in `telegram/backend.py`. Closed by adding `MarkdownFormatter.refresh_from(progress_settings)` and `TelegramPresenter.refresh_progress_settings()`, plus a new `runner_bridge._load_progress_settings()` sibling helper that `handle_message` invokes per-run; the runner bridge now refreshes the default presenter's formatter (per-chat `/verbose` overrides downstream of `_resolve_presenter` reconstruct from the refreshed defaults so they pick up the new values too) and threads the live `min_render_interval` into each `ProgressEdits` instance instead of the startup snapshot. Out of scope (entry-point limitation, documented on the issue): engine registration and command registration — those still require `pipx upgrade` / restart. 8 new tests in `tests/test_meta_line.py` (`TestMarkdownFormatterRefresh`: max_actions, verbosity, negative-clamp, invalid-verbosity rejection, missing-attribute tolerance, presenter delegation; plus `_load_progress_settings` defaults / error-fallback covers). Full suite: 2511 passed [#269](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/269)
- **feat:** Claude post-result idle timeout + "✓ turn complete" UX hint (Option D hybrid). Closes the "session looks stuck for 36 min after final message" gap by combining (a) an immediate footer signal so the user knows the turn is done, and (b) a server-side timer that closes stdin when the bidirectional Claude CLI sits idle past the new `[watchdog].post_result_idle_timeout` (default 600s, range 30s–1h; gated by `[watchdog].post_result_idle_enabled = true` for an explicit kill-switch). Mechanism: `ClaudeStreamState.result_received_at` is armed by `translate_claude_event` on every `StreamResultMessage`; a new `ClaudeRunner._post_result_idle_watchdog` task started in the `run_impl` task group polls the timer and calls `this_proc_stdin.aclose()` once the deadline passes — same mechanism as the normal-flow exit on line 2412, just earlier. The CLI hits stdin EOF and exits gracefully (rc=0); the auto-continue safety gate already excludes `last_event_type == "result"` (locked by `test_skips_result_event_type` from #34142's regression set) so the clean exit will not phantom-resume the session. Approval-state guard: if `_REQUEST_TO_SESSION` or `_PENDING_ASK_REQUESTS` has live entries for this session the timer re-arms instead of closing — prevents orphaning a button-click control_response that's mid-flight. UX hint #1 is delivered via a supplementary `StartedEvent` carrying `meta={"complete": "✓ turn complete"}` (the supported pattern for late-arriving meta per `runner-development.md`); `markdown.format_meta_line` renders it in the footer alongside model/effort/permission/trigger so the user immediately sees the turn boundary. Successful results emit the hint; errored results don't (no false "complete" tag on a failure). Two structlog events for ops: `claude.post_result_idle.deferred` (when the approval guard fires) and `claude.post_result_idle.closing_stdin` (when the deadline passes cleanly). 6 new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_translate_result_arms_post_result_idle_timer`, `test_translate_result_emits_turn_complete_meta`, `test_translate_result_skips_complete_meta_on_error`, `test_post_result_idle_watchdog_fires_when_clean`, `test_post_result_idle_watchdog_defers_when_pending_approval`, `test_meta_line_renders_turn_complete_marker`, `test_meta_line_omits_complete_when_absent`) [#333](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/333)
- **feat:** trigger visibility Tier 2 (`/config:tg` page expansion) + Tier 3 (`last_fired_at` history + `/stats` triggered/manual breakdown). The `/config → ⏰ Triggers` page now lists every cron and webhook configured for the current chat — for crons, the human-readable schedule via `describe_cron(schedule, timezone)`, project, engine, and last-fired relative time; for webhooks, path, auth scheme, project, engine, and last-fired. Lists are scoped to the current chat (using `crons_for_chat` / `webhooks_for_chat` with the bridge `default_chat_id` fallback), capped at 10 entries with a "…and N more (see untether.toml)" overflow marker, and omitted entirely when the chat has no triggers (the pause/resume controls remain at the top regardless). Tier 3 adds a new persistent JSON history store (`src/untether/triggers/history.py`) at `<config_path>.with_name("triggers_history.json")` that records `time.time()` after every successful cron dispatch (`triggers/cron.py:130` post-`dispatch_cron`) and webhook fire (`triggers/dispatcher.py:dispatch_webhook` and `dispatch_action` for non-agent actions). Recording is best-effort — `OSError` writes log `triggers.history.write_failed` and swallow so a transient disk failure can't break the cron loop or webhook server. `/stats` now appends `(N triggered, M manual)` per engine line and on the totals row when at least one count is > 0; `DayBucket` and `AggregatedStats` carry additive `triggered_count` / `manual_count` fields with `.get(..., 0)` fallbacks so existing `stats.json` files load cleanly. `runner_bridge.handle_message` resolves the split via `triggered=bool(context and context.trigger_source)` at the existing `record_run` callsite. New `triggers_history.json` state file is created on demand and survives restart; renaming a trigger ID in TOML leaves a stale entry that operators can manually delete (no auto-prune to avoid losing data on transient TOML errors). 28 new tests across `tests/test_triggers_history.py` (10), `tests/test_session_stats.py::triggered/manual` (7), `tests/test_stats_command.py` (3), `tests/test_config_command.py::TestTriggersPagePerChat` (7), `tests/test_trigger_cron.py` (2 cron-firing + history-failure resilience), and `tests/test_trigger_dispatcher.py` (2 webhook recording + history-failure resilience) [#271](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/271)
- **feat:** subscription-usage observability + `/usage debug` section. Promotes the `claude_usage.schema_mismatch` structlog warning from one-shot per-process to per-call counter so the issue-watcher fires on ongoing API-shape drift, not just the first hit (the structured event now carries a cumulative `count` field; new `runner_bridge.get_usage_schema_mismatch_count()` exposes the same counter for the debug page). Adds `UsageCacheStats` to `utils/usage_cache.py` tracking last successful fetch wall time, cache age, last-error class+message; populated by `fetch_claude_usage_cached` on every fetch path including stale-while-error fallbacks. Adds `_read_token_expiry_ms()` to `telegram/commands/usage.py` so the OAuth token expiry can be surfaced without raising on missing credentials. New `/usage debug` invocation appends a `🔧 debug` block (HTML-formatted) showing: last successful fetch (UTC ISO timestamp + age + freshness label), last error (class + message, truncated), OAuth token expiry (with hh/mm-until-expiry), and the cumulative schema-mismatch counter — operator-facing signal so the next time the subscription footer goes silent the root cause is visible without grepping `journalctl`. 5 new tests in `tests/test_usage_cache.py::TestCacheStatsObservability` (initial state, success records wall time, failure records last error, success-then-failure preserves wall time) and `tests/test_command_engine_gates.py::TestUsageDebugMode` (debug section appended only when `args_text == "debug"`); existing `test_schema_mismatch_warning_fires_once` repurposed to assert per-call firing with cumulative counts [#410](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/410)
- **feat:** `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` is now user-configurable via `[watchdog] claude_stream_idle_timeout_ms` in `untether.toml` (default 300000 ms / 5 min, range 30 s – 30 min). Deployments that hit upstream Anthropic API stalls on long opus 4.7 1M plan-mode generations (Type-A mid-generation stalls) can raise this to 600000–900000 ms to ride out longer SSE silences. Untether's Claude runner reads the value via `setdefault` so shell-set `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` still wins. Settings load failure falls back to the hardcoded 300000 ms default with a debug log entry. **Type-A vs Type-B classification on the failure message**: when the run fails with `API Error: Stream idle timeout - partial response received`, the `_extract_error` output now appends a one-line classification: Type-A (mid-generation, `num_turns ≥ 1 && duration_api_ms > 0`) suggests raising the timeout; Type-B (cold-start zero-byte stall, `num_turns ≤ 1 && duration_api_ms == 0`) explicitly tells the user that raising the timeout will NOT help — it's an upstream API outage, not a local watchdog miscalibration. Auto-retry deferred to v0.35.4 pending upstream Anthropic stabilisation. 5 new tests in `test_claude_runner.py` (`test_extract_error_type_a_*`, `test_extract_error_type_b_*`, `test_extract_error_unrelated_*`, `test_env_stream_idle_timeout_configured_value`, `test_env_stream_idle_timeout_settings_load_failure_falls_back`) [#438](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/438)
- **feat:** master pause/resume toggle for the trigger system (crons + webhooks). Adds `TriggerManager.pause()` / `resume()` / `is_paused` API; cron scheduler skips its tick while paused (`run_once` crons are not consumed during the pause and fire on the next matching tick after resume); webhook server returns `503 triggers paused` (with `Retry-After: 60`) instead of dispatching, and the `/health` endpoint surfaces `{"status":"paused","paused":true}` so external monitors can distinguish paused-but-up from healthy. Pause is in-memory only — restart auto-resumes (the safe default). Wired into `/config` two ways: a one-button toggle row at the bottom of the home page (only when triggers are configured) and a dedicated `📡 Triggers` page (`config:tg`) with state + counts. `/ping` switches to a `⏸ triggers paused: … (suspended)` indicator while paused. 8 new tests in `test_trigger_manager.py` (`TestPauseToggle`), 2 in `test_ping_command.py` (paused/resumed indicators), 5 in `test_config_command.py` (`TestTriggersPage`) covering unavailable / empty / pause / resume / toast labels [#294](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/294)
- **feat:** `[claude]` config gains `extra_args: list[str]` — user-supplied upstream CLI flags passed through to `claude` verbatim. Mirrors `codex.extra_args` and `pi.extra_args`. Primary motivator is Claude-in-Chrome: Claude Code 2.1.x gates the `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tool namespace behind `--chrome` (or `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_CFC=1`), so Untether-spawned sessions never saw those tools in their catalogue. Setting `extra_args = ["--chrome"]` in `~/.untether/untether.toml` now enables Claude-in-Chrome end-to-end without forking Untether or touching the LaunchAgent/systemd env. Flags Untether manages internally (`-p`, `--print`, `--output-format`, `--input-format`, `--resume`/`-r`, `--continue`/`-c`, `--permission-mode`, `--permission-prompt-tool`) are rejected at config-load with a `ConfigError` so duplicate-argv surprises fail fast instead of at runtime. The user-supplied args land on argv after Untether's managed stream-json prelude and before resume / model / effort / allowed-tools / permission flags, so the trailing `-p <prompt>` (or stdin prompt under permission-mode) is never displaced. 8 new unit tests in `tests/test_build_args.py` cover argv ordering, permission-mode argv, multi-flag order preservation, `build_runner` parsing, and reserved-flag rejection (individual flag + `key=value` prefix form) [#407](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/407)
- **feat:** user-extensible engine-subprocess env allowlist — two new `[security]` keys let self-installed Untether users thread credential-manager tokens (1Password, Doppler, Vault, Infisical, …) into engine subprocesses without forking `utils/env_policy.py`. `env_extra_allow: list[str]` admits exact names (e.g. `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`); `env_extra_prefix_allow: list[str]` admits whole families (e.g. `VAULT_*` via `["VAULT_"]`). Both are validated against `[A-Z_][A-Z0-9_]*` at config-load — empty / whitespace / lowercase / leading-digit entries are rejected. Honoured by the Claude and Pi runners (the engines that opt in to `filtered_env`) and by the `env_audit` probe (so user-allowed names aren't false-flagged as `claude.env_audit.leaked_var`). One `env_policy.user_extension` INFO log per process at first runner spawn. `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Bitwarden Secrets Manager — common enough to ship by default) is also promoted into the built-in `_EXACT_ALLOW`. 19 new tests across `test_env_policy.py`, `test_env_audit.py`, `test_settings.py` [#409](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/409)
- **feat:** `/trigger` command renamed to `/listen` to disambiguate from the webhook/cron triggers system. The chat-level message-routing command (`all` / `mentions` / `clear`) shared its name with the unrelated `[triggers]` TOML section, which became increasingly confusing as `/config` grew separate trigger pages. `/listen` is now the canonical command; `/trigger` continues to work as a deprecated alias for one release cycle and prepends a one-line deprecation notice on each invocation. `/config → 📡 Listen` page replaces the prior `📡 Trigger` page; the home-page summary renders `Listen: all` instead of `Trigger: all`; bot command menu lists `listen`. Internal renames: `telegram/trigger_mode.py` → `telegram/listen_mode.py`; `commands/trigger.py` → `commands/listen.py`; type `TriggerMode` → `ListenMode`; `resolve_trigger_mode()` → `resolve_listen_mode()`; ChatPrefsStore / TopicStateStore gain new `*_listen_mode` methods with legacy `*_trigger_mode` aliases preserved for one cycle. Storage: msgspec field is still named `trigger_mode` for backward compat with existing `telegram_chat_prefs_state.json` / `telegram_topics_state.json` — no migration needed [#297](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/297)
- **feat:** long-running tool visibility — Bash, BashOutput, ScheduleWakeup, Monitor, and any other tool > 60 s now surfaces a heartbeat-driven elapsed-time tail on the progress message (`▸ Bash · 3m 47s · npm run build`) so a glancing user can answer "is it alive? what is it doing? for how long?" without waiting for the next JSONL event. Two coordinated upgrades: (1) a 30 s heartbeat tick (new `[progress] heartbeat_interval`, range 5–120 s, default 30) folded into the existing stall monitor — every tick walks `ProgressTracker._actions` and bumps `event_seq` whenever any open action's `started_at` is older than 60 s, forcing a re-render with a fresh elapsed counter; (2) `format_action_line` gained an `elapsed_seconds` kwarg that appends ` · <elapsed> · <key arg>` for non-completed actions, regardless of the `/verbose` toggle. `format_verbose_detail` gained dedicated branches for `BashOutput` (renders the last line of `result_preview` so 10-min Cloudflare deploy polls show `→ Deploy Production: in_progress` instead of a static `▸ BashOutput`), `KillShell`, `ScheduleWakeup` (countdown + reason: `→ fires in 4m 12s · "build check"`), and `Monitor` (countdown remaining). `ActionState` gained `started_at` / `last_update_at` wall-clock fields populated from the `ProgressTracker.clock` callable (defaults to `time.monotonic`; tests can pass a fake clock for deterministic assertions). The render pipeline (`MarkdownFormatter.render_progress_parts`, `MarkdownPresenter.render_progress`, `Presenter.render_progress` Protocol, `TelegramPresenter.render_progress`) all gained an optional `now: float | None` kwarg threaded from `runner_bridge._run_loop`. New `format_duration` / `format_countdown` helpers in `markdown.py`. Strict "rolling stdout sub-line ≤ every 5 s" cannot be achieved without upstream Claude Code changes — the BashOutput-polling path is the proxy and refreshes at each polling cycle (~15 s in practice). 22 new tests across `tests/test_verbose_progress.py` (BashOutput / KillShell / ScheduleWakeup / Monitor detail + long-running tail variants + format_duration helpers) and `tests/test_exec_bridge.py` (heartbeat-driven countdown mutation) [#481](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/481)
- **feat:** expected-wait stall suppression matrix — five new info-logged branches in `ProgressEdits._stall_monitor` suppress Telegram stall warnings during legitimate waits, gated by a `if not frozen_escalate` master gate so genuinely-frozen sessions still warn. Branches: (1) `progress_edits.stall_post_result_suppressed` — `stream.last_event_type == "result"` and `engine_state.result_received_at` armed (the post-result idle watchdog from #333 is the legitimate owner of the silence); (2) `progress_edits.stall_schedule_wakeup_suppressed` — `engine_state.live_wakeups` has any deadline in the future (Claude is parked waiting for an upstream timer); (3) `progress_edits.stall_monitor_active_suppressed` — `engine_state.live_monitors` has any future deadline; (4) `progress_edits.stall_bash_grace_suppressed` — most-recent action is Bash/BashOutput/KillShell within the new `[watchdog] bash_grace_seconds` (range 5–300 s, default 60) startup window; (5) `progress_edits.stall_long_bash_suppressed` — recent BashOutput within `stall_threshold/2` (the polling cycle is the proxy for "stdout is flowing"). The same 5 booleans gate the `_STALL_MAX_WARNINGS` auto-cancel arm with a new `progress_edits.stall_auto_cancel_suppressed_expected_wait` log — a session about to gracefully close (#470) or legitimately waiting on a timer must not be killed. structlog WARN events at `runner.py:1002` (`subprocess.liveness_stall`) and `runner_bridge.py` (`progress_edits.stall_detected`) remain unchanged so `untether-issue-watcher` and ops dashboards continue to receive them — only the chat-side surfacing decision changed. Bash/BashOutput suppression uses `tracker._actions` engine-agnostically (mirrors `_has_running_mcp_tool`); ScheduleWakeup / Monitor / post-result use `getattr(stream, "engine_state", None)` duck-typing (Claude only today, no-ops cleanly for other engines). 11 new tests in `tests/test_exec_bridge.py` covering each suppression branch, the auto-cancel block, the closing-message idempotency, the heartbeat countdown mutation, and the frozen-ring precedence (post-result + ScheduleWakeup) [#481](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/481)
- **feat:** /loop and ScheduleWakeup support — opt-in observation of Claude Code's session-scoped scheduling tools so iterations keep firing after the subprocess exits. **Default OFF** — users opt in per chat via `/config → 🔁 Loop mode`. New `loop_scheduler` module sibling of `at_scheduler` (mirrors install/uninstall/active_count API) with persistence to `active_loops.json` for restart resilience. Observer hooks in the Claude runner's JSONL stream-translation path (`_observe_loop_tool_use` / `_observe_loop_tool_result`, sibling functions to the existing `_register_background_handle` / `_clear_background_handle` background-task tracker) parse the canonical Probe-5-confirmed field names (`cron` not `cron_expression`; `id` not `taskId`/`cronId`) and bind upstream 8-character cron IDs via `\bjob ([0-9a-f]{8})\b`. Race avoidance gates fire on `is_session_alive` (added pre-#289 as `3362ae9`) — if the subprocess is still parked on a control_request, the fire path sleeps `redundancy_check_interval` and retries instead of double-firing. Drop-on-busy via `is_chat_busy` callable mirrors upstream's "no catch-up" semantic. Re-issue prompts wrap the original user prompt with `Loop iteration N: <prompt>. Do the task now; do not summarize old results unless necessary.` (per Probe 3 result + consensus revision). Cost protection delegated entirely to existing `[cost_budget]` infrastructure — every loop fire calls `cost_tracker.record_run_cost`, every loop iteration is subject to the same daily/per-run caps as manual runs. New `[loop]` config section provides runaway-safety caps (`max_iterations`, `max_total_duration_hours`, `expiry_days`) but explicitly NOT cost caps. Drain integration in `_drain_and_exit` polls `loop_scheduler.active_count()` alongside `pending_at`. `/cancel` and `/new` both call `cancel_pending_for_chat` which writes the do-not-resume sentinel for the cancelled session (block only loop_scheduler `--resume`, not `/continue` per handover default). New `_page_loop()` sub-page in `/config` with explicit cost+quota warning before turning ON; engine-aware (Claude only — `LOOP_SUPPORTED_ENGINES = frozenset({"claude"})`); `💰 Set a budget` deeplink to `config:cu` for one-tap budget setup. 5 doc files updated (schedule-tasks how-to, cost-budgets callout, troubleshooting symptom table, FAQ Q, config reference `[loop]` section). Empirically grounded — `claude --resume` does NOT restore session-scoped cron tasks in `claude` v2.1.129/2.1.132 in `--print` mode (Probe 1), so Untether owns ALL firing across both CronCreate and ScheduleWakeup tool families. 58 new tests across `tests/test_loop_scheduler.py` (41), `tests/test_claude_runner.py::TestLoopObservation` (10 + 1 sync), and `tests/test_config_command.py::TestLoopMode` (7) [#289](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/289)

### fixes

- **fix:** media-group file uploads (two or more files sent together) failed with "no project context available for file upload" on single-project DM deployments. `_handle_media_group` in `telegram/commands/media.py` resolved the run context from topic state only, never consulting the per-chat `ChatPrefsStore` (`/ctx`-bound context) — unlike the single-file path (`loop.py:build_message_context`), which has a topic-bound → chat-bound → topic-merged-default fallback ladder. On a host with no `default_project` and no project `chat_id` (e.g. the channelo VPS, where the config validator forbids a project `chat_id` equal to `transports.telegram.chat_id`), the `/ctx`-bound chat context is the only project resolver, so media groups resolved no project while single-file uploads worked. Not a v0.35.3 regression — the gap has existed since `media.py` was introduced (pre-0.35.0); the channelo single-project-DM deployment is the first config shape to expose it. Threaded `chat_prefs` through `MediaGroupBuffer` → `_handle_media_group` and mirrored the `build_message_context` ladder (with a `# keep in sync` comment); regression test `test_media_group_uses_chat_prefs_bound_context` added in `tests/test_telegram_media_command.py`. PR #563 [#562](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/562)
- **fix:** rc20 — outbox + watchdog approval-pending follow-ups completing the rc19 patches that landed in only one code path. PR #556. Covers [#524](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/524) and [#526](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/526).
  - **#524 — outbox skipped items surfaced across all completion paths:** rc19 (#555) added `_surface_outbox_skipped` on the normal-completion path in `runner_bridge.handle_message`. /monitor audits on 2026-05-18 caught the regression still firing because two adjacent paths were untouched — the pre-auto-continue delivery (subprocess 1 stuck-after-tool-result recovery) and the `run_ok=False` failed-run branch — and both silently dropped the agent's intended deliverable. rc20 extracts the surfacing logic into `_surface_outbox_skipped` in `runner_bridge.py` and wires it into both gap paths. Failed runs still skip the actual file send (preserving the original gating) but do a cheap `scan_outbox()` to collect skipped items and surface them so the user always learns what the agent intended to ship. Honours the existing `outbox_notify_skipped` config flag and filters the `…` overflow pseudo-entry. Tests in `tests/test_exec_bridge.py` cover failed-run surfacing, `notify_skipped=false` suppression, and the only-overflow filter [#524](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/524)
  - **#526 — approval-pending stalls demoted in the watchdog-side detector too:** rc19 demoted the bridge-side `progress_edits.stall_detected` WARN to a paced INFO when `_has_pending_approval()` returned true, but the watchdog-side detector in `runner.py` (which emits `subprocess.liveness_stall` — the signal `untether-issue-watcher` actually files on) was untouched, so the daemon kept filing GitHub issues on routine approval-pending sessions and the nsd audit (2026-05-18) showed a user cancelling a productive 15-minute investigation because the chat-side reassurance came too late (1800s threshold). rc20 adds `_recent_event_is_control_request` helper in `runner.py` using the stream's `recent_events` ring buffer; plumbs the predicate into `_watchdog_loop` so when the last JSONL event is `control_request` it emits `subprocess.approval_pending` INFO instead of `liveness_stall` WARN, skips the auto-kill branch entirely, and paces INFO emission once per 30 min via shared `_APPROVAL_PENDING_REFIRE_S`. Splits `_STALL_THRESHOLD_APPROVAL_FIRST` (600s) and the existing 1800s refire so the user gets a reassuring "tap a button above" chat message at 10 min on first occurrence — fixes the nsd-style early cancellation. Rewords the chat-side approval reminder copy to make the "tap a button above to proceed (no action needed otherwise)" affordance explicit. Tests in `tests/test_exec_bridge.py` (failed-run surfacing, suppression flag, two-tier first-reminder threshold, reworded copy) and `tests/test_exec_runner.py` (predicate truth-table coverage, watchdog demotion via integration with a fake codex script emitting `control_request`, watchdog WARN still fires when no `control_request` is recent) [#526](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/526)
- **fix:** rc19 — `/monitor` campaign issue sweep, 7 additional issues bundled from staging audits (2026-05-13 through 2026-05-16). PR #555. Covers [#523](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/523), [#525](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/525), [#528](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/528), [#532](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/532), [#546](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/546), [#547](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/547), and [#548](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/548).
  - **#528 — `↩️ Answered:` echo no longer truncated to 100 chars** after `AskUserQuestion` text replies. The agent path was unaffected and always received the complete text; only the user-facing confirmation was truncated, so users couldn't see whether their full message reached the agent. Replaced the hard `[:100]` slice with a 300-char soft cap + ellipsis via new `_format_answered_echo` helper. Regression tests in `tests/test_loop_coverage.py` [#528](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/528)
  - **#525 — dedup `cancel.requested` triple-fire** with 1-second TTL on `(chat_id, progress_message_id)` across all three cancel entry points (text-reply, text-fallback, callback). Telegram duplicate callback deliveries before keyboard clearing produced 3× fan-out of one user intent. Repeat `cancel_requested.set()` was benign today, but log noise + future side-effectful cancel actions would inherit the fan-out. Per-test autouse fixture clears the module-level dict between tests so test reuse of the same `(chat_id, msg_id)` isn't surprised by silent drops [#525](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/525)
  - **#532 — per-engine `setup.warning` consolidated to single `setup.summary` INFO** per `config.reload.applied`. Previously every reload emitted one `setup.warning` per engine not on PATH (5 WARNs on a single-engine host like channelo, which runs only Claude); the noise padded WARN filters in `untether-issue-watcher`, `/monitor`, and Grafana with intentional install state. The summary INFO captures the same install state for diagnostics without the WARN noise [#532](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/532)
  - **#523 — slash-command typo recognition** for leading-dot variants (`.new`, `.usage`, …). Previously dispatched a full agent run and incurred the full Claude cost when a user mistyped a slash command. Now the bot recognises the typo pattern and replies with a correction suggesting the proper `/new` / `/usage` form [#523](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/523)
  - **#547 axes 1+2 — agent self-restart pattern broken at source.** Documented incident (2026-05-16 15:25-15:30 AEST): an agent editing `untether.toml` follows up with `Bash systemctl --user restart untether`, unaware Untether already hot-reloaded the change. The restart is issued from inside the only active run, the graceful drain has nothing it CAN drain, drain waits the full 120s `timeout_s`, force-exits with `outbox.fail_pending count=1` (agent's final answer silently dropped), then restarts. Axis 1 (commit `12cf4ca`): `_DEFAULT_PREAMBLE` in `runner_bridge.py` now warns agents that `untether.toml` is hot-reloaded and `systemctl restart` is unnecessary. Axis 2 (commit `40dc6b7`, paired with #548): Telegram confirmation message on successful reload ("♻️ Hot-reloaded …") — closes the feedback-loop gap that drove agents to reach for `systemctl restart` as a safety blanket. Axis 3 (defensive drain-timeout heuristic that shortens the 120s drain when the only active session IS the one triggering the shutdown) deferred to v0.35.4 as [#559](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/559) [#547](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/547)
  - **#548 — hot-reload success Telegram notification** with explicit "no restart needed" framing. `config_watch.handle_reload()` now sends a brief confirmation to the chat that triggered the reload (e.g. "♻️ Hot-reloaded `untether.toml` — No restart needed."), so the next agent turn sees positive confirmation in context. Closes the "did this actually work?" gap that drove the #547 self-restart pattern [#548](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/548)
  - **#546 — `answer_callback_query` bypasses the outbox** to restore the ~220ms callback latency baseline under rapid-click clusters. The 6-10× latency escalation on the 2nd/3rd click (1.4-2.9s) was caused by outbox serialisation. All `callback.answered.latency_ms` values now stay near baseline regardless of click cadence [#546](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/546)
- **fix:** rc18 — `_post_result_idle_watchdog` post-result hang root cause + AskUserQuestion final-keyboard clear + auto-continue outbox+UX. Three independent rc18 fixes shipped together. Covers [#333](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/333), [#550](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/550), and [#551](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/551).
  - **#333 — post-result hang fix (Tier 1+2+3 + Task 4a):** rc17 (#549) added entry/exit/tick instrumentation to the watchdog; that instrumentation caught the limbo on channelo session `8876c902` (2026-05-17, 26.6 min wasted). Root cause: when Claude Code v2.1.143 closes stdout while keeping the subprocess alive, the watchdog exited early via `task_exited reason=reader_done`, bypassing the 600 s countdown — and stall-detector suppression cascades (post_result + MCP-heartbeat-driven children-active) hid the limbo from auto-cancel indefinitely. **Tier 1 (`claude.py`):** when `reader_done` fires while `proc.returncode is None`, the new `_post_result_subcountdown` re-arms a stdout-closed countdown, defers on pending control_request / ask_question, then SIGTERMs the process group after `timeout_s`, 5 s grace, SIGKILL if still alive. New `task_exited` reasons: `reader_done_but_alive_timeout`, `subprocess_exited_during_subcountdown`. **Tier 2 (`runner_bridge.py`):** new `_POST_RESULT_LIMBO_THRESHOLD_S = 660.0` class const + `_post_result_idle_age_seconds()` helper; when post-result idle age exceeds the threshold AND no other expected-wait flag is set, the stall detector stops suppressing auto-cancel. One-shot `progress_edits.post_result_limbo_detected` warning. **Tier 3 (`claude.py`):** new `runner.limbo_detected` warning fired 30 s into the subcountdown when the subprocess is still alive — picked up automatically by `untether-issue-watcher` for `auto:error-report` filing on future regressions. **Task 4a (`runner.py` + `claude.py`):** `JsonlStreamState.lifecycle_state` + `_transition_lifecycle()` helper emits `subprocess.state.<name>` info logs at every transition (`reader_eof`, `subcountdown`, `limbo`, `sigterm_sent`, `sigkill_sent`, `exited`). Permanent canary for future hang-class issues. 7 new tests (4 in `tests/test_claude_runner.py`, 3 in `tests/test_exec_bridge.py`) [#333](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/333)
  - **#550 — AskUserQuestion final-keyboard clear:** after the user answers the last question in a multi-question `AskUserQuestion` flow, the inline keyboard on the question message is now stripped via `ctx.executor.edit` (Approach A from the rc18 handover). Previously the buttons stayed clickable and fired `ask_question.flow_missing` warnings since the flow state was already cleaned up. Failure modes preserved: `answer_ask_question_with_options` returning `False` leaves the buttons in place (so the user can retry); `ctx.executor.edit` raising logs `ask_question.keyboard_clear_failed` but does NOT block the answer-sent return. 4 new tests in `tests/test_ask_user_question.py` [#550](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/550)
  - **#551 — auto-continue outbox + UX (Tier 0 + Tier 1):** **Tier 0:** outbox files written by subprocess 1 during the stuck-after-tool-results window are now delivered BEFORE subprocess 2 spawns, eliminating the ~3.6% silent loss observed on lba-1. The pre-swap call mirrors the existing `deliver_outbox_files` plumbing at the final-message site (cleanup=True so subprocess 2 starts fresh). Failure to deliver does NOT block auto-continue — the recovery is more important than any single batch of files; new `outbox.delivered_pre_auto_continue` info + `outbox.auto_continue_delivery_failed` warning logs. **Tier 1:** the auto-continue Telegram notice text changed from `⚠️ Auto-continuing — Claude stopped before processing tool results` to `🔁 Auto-resuming session after upstream Claude Code event`. The 🔁 prefix signals recovery rather than failure and discourages users from `/cancel`-ing the salvage. **Task 4b (`runner.py` + `runner_bridge.py`):** `JsonlStreamState.stall_suppression_counts: dict[str, int]` + `_bump_stall_suppression()` helper increments per-suppression-reason counters at three sites (`expected_wait`, `post_result`, `children_active`). `session.summary` now includes a stable `stall_suppressions=expected_wait:N,post_result:N,children_active:N` summary line so log audits can spot suppression cascades without parsing nested JSON. Stretch tiers (#551 Tier 2/3/4 — catalog-staleness suppression window, rate-limit-aware deferral, registry preservation) deferred to a future patch [#551](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/551)
- **fix:** rc17 — `_post_result_idle_watchdog` entry/exit/tick instrumentation (#333) + `last_bg_bash_launched_at` scalar (latent #347 sibling defect). Channelo VPS on rc16 (which already shipped the #544 ScheduleWakeup arm-delay scalar) hit a 43+ min post-result hang on session `b5c1c3e0-…` with `pending_wakeup=False` — i.e. NO `ScheduleWakeup` involved, so the #544 fix didn't apply. Logs showed `post_result=True` (so `state.result_received_at` IS set), `[watchdog]` config used the default `post_result_idle_enabled=true`, and the subprocess + children stayed alive (so `reader_done` was NOT set) — yet **zero** `claude.post_result_idle.closing_stdin` / `…deferred` log lines existed despite elapsed ≫ 600 s. Three of the four #333 candidates ruled out via logs + live `py-spy dump`; the remaining "task crashed silently / never started" candidate cannot be discriminated without entry/exit instrumentation. The CHANGELOG line in rc16 deferred #333 to v0.35.4 pending instrumentation — rc17 lands the instrumentation now and overrides that deferral. **Instrumentation:** `_post_result_idle_watchdog` now emits `claude.post_result_idle.task_started` (session_id, timeout_s, poll_interval_s) at entry; `claude.post_result_idle.tick` every iteration (armed, elapsed_s, effective_timeout_s, dead_wakeup, pending_requests, pending_asks, would_close, last_bg_bash_launched_at_age_s, last_schedule_wakeup_arm_delay); `claude.post_result_idle.tick_error` (warning + exc_info) on transient per-tick failures with one-interval backoff; and `claude.post_result_idle.task_exited` (reason ∈ `reader_done` | `stdin_closed` | `cancelled` | `loop_exited`) in a guaranteed `finally`. Per-tick `try/except` (not loop-wide) mirrors `_subprocess_watchdog` / `_drain_catalog_refresh` conventions so a transient error never cancels the sibling `_iter_jsonl_events` task in the task group. Verbose by design — at 30 s poll × hours of session = O(120) lines, trivial; rate-limiting now would create ambiguity in the next reproduction. **`last_bg_bash_launched_at` scalar:** `_clear_background_handle` (claude.py:550) pops `live_bg_bashes` on tool_result mirroring the original #507 ScheduleWakeup defect that #544 fixed via a scalar high-water-mark; new `ClaudeStreamState.last_bg_bash_launched_at: float | None` is set in `_register_background_handle` at the `Bash + run_in_background` branch, NOT cleared in `_clear_background_handle`, and reset on the same fresh-user-prompt path that resets `last_schedule_wakeup_arm_delay`. Critically a LAUNCH tracker, not a LIFETIME tracker — bg-bashes can outlive multiple user turns (long `npm install`, `tail -f`) so per-turn reset is correct. **Observability-only today**; the bridge's existing `_has_fresh_bash_output` / `_has_recent_bash_action` (runner_bridge.py:1738, 1753) remain the higher-fidelity bash-liveness proxies and the new scalar deliberately does NOT replace them in any suppression path. 7 new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (5 scalar lifecycle + 2 watchdog instrumentation covering `task_started`/`tick`/`task_exited` ordering and the `reader_done` exit path). The actual fix for whatever the new instrumentation reveals lands in a follow-up rc — rc17 is the diagnostic [#333](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/333) (cross-ref [#544](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/544), [#347](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/347), [#374](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/374))
- **fix:** rc16 — `ScheduleWakeup` post-result hold-open redux. The rc11 #507 fix added a `state.live_wakeups_arm_delay: dict[str, float]` populated in `_register_background_handle` and read in `_post_result_idle_watchdog` to shorten the 600 s timeout to `max_armed_delay + 60 s` when /loop is OFF. But the dict was wiped by `_clear_background_handle` on the ScheduleWakeup tool_result — which is the schedule-confirmation, not a terminal signal — so by the time the watchdog ticked (after the `result` event, which lands AFTER tool_result) the dict was empty and the dead-wakeup shortcut never engaged. Live impact: channelo VPS auditor-toolkit session `d11739ee-…` on rc15, 24+ min hold-open with `pending_wakeup=False` despite `last_action='tool:ScheduleWakeup (done)'`. Replaced the per-tool_id dict with `ClaudeStreamState.last_schedule_wakeup_arm_delay: float | None` — a per-turn scalar high-water-mark (`max` semantics for multi-wakeup turns) that survives `_clear_background_handle` and resets on each fresh user prompt (`StreamUserMessage` with non-tool_result content; mixed batches preserve the scalar). 4 new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` cover the full tool_use → tool_result → result lifecycle (the #507 unit tests bypassed `_clear_background_handle`, which is why this slipped through), multi-wakeup max selection, new-turn reset, and the mixed-batch edge case. The two existing #507 tests now seed the scalar instead of the dict. The broader background-task-lifecycle refactor (terminal-vs-arm signal per primitive + deadline-expiry sweeps) tracked in [#374](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/374) stays in v0.35.4; the sibling defect where the 600 s safety-net watchdog silently doesn't fire stays in [#333](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/333) for v0.35.4 pending entry/exit instrumentation [#544](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/544)
- **fix:** rc14 — `claude.rate_limit_event` logs no longer drop `retry_after_s` on subscription-cap (reset-window) throttles. The Claude CLI emits two shapes of `rate_limit_event`: a full form carrying `retry_after_ms` (already covered) and a bare/reset-window form that carries `requests_reset` / `tokens_reset` ISO timestamps but no `retry_after_ms`. Untether's translate path only consumed `retry_after_ms`, so reset-window events fell into the "no retry hint" branch — `retry_after_s` stayed `None`, `ClaudeStreamState.rate_limit_total_s` never accumulated, and the chat surfaced the generic "⏳ Rate limited — waiting to retry" with no actionable wait time. The rc13 audit observed this firing across a 5-event burst on the `bip` chat that preceded a subscription-cap exhaustion across 3 chats — every event logged `retry_after_s=None cumulative_s=0.0` despite the upstream payload containing actionable wait info. New `_derive_retry_after_s(info)` helper in `runners/claude.py` picks the EARLIER of `requests_reset` / `tokens_reset` (the rate limit lifts as soon as either budget refills), clamps ≥ 0, tolerates both `Z` and `+00:00` ISO suffixes, and returns `None` for unparseable / missing timestamps. The translate path now falls back to the derived value when `retry_after_ms` is `None` and tracks which path fed the field via a new `retry_after_source=retry_after_ms|reset_ts` log key. The structured `claude.rate_limit_event` is also enriched to include every present `RateLimitInfo` field under `info=...` (`requests_limit`, `requests_remaining`, `requests_reset`, `tokens_limit`, `tokens_remaining`, `tokens_reset`, `retry_after_ms`) so future audits can see what upstream actually sent. The two subscription-error message variants observed in the audit ("out of extra usage", "hit your limit") already map to the same friendly hint via `error_hints.py:52-60`, so no work is needed there. Pre-emptive 75/90% budget warnings are out of scope for this fix — deferred as a discrete feature. 4 new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_translate_rate_limit_event_derives_retry_after_from_reset_ts`, `test_translate_rate_limit_event_prefers_earlier_reset_when_both_present`, `test_translate_rate_limit_event_retry_after_ms_takes_precedence`, `test_translate_rate_limit_event_handles_unparseable_reset_ts`); all four existing tests still pass [#518](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/518)
- **fix:** rc14 — `catalog.refresh_sent` per-session debounce. The opt-in `[watchdog] notify_catalog_refresh = true` path (#365) previously enqueued one `mcp_status` control_request on every `tool_result` batch, with no minimum interval. The 2026-05-09 monitor audit observed this firing 183 times in a single ~18 min Claude run on the `scout` project — a "storm" that floods the runner's stdin and Claude Code's catalog-status query path. New `WatchdogSettings.catalog_refresh_min_interval_s` (default 5.0 s, range 0–60 s; 0 disables the gate and restores pre-#497 behaviour) drives a per-session `last_catalog_refresh_queued_at` monotonic-clock check in `translate_claude_event`'s `StreamUserMessage` arm. Burst tool_results now produce one refresh per 5 s window instead of one per batch — 183 fires / 1080 s collapses to ≤ 216 in the worst case, typically far fewer once tool_results cluster. The setting is plumbed through `ClaudeRunner._init_state_from_settings` so live reloads pick up the value on next session. The existing `test_tool_result_queues_mcp_status_when_notify_enabled` test was updated to drive `time.monotonic()` past the debounce window between the two queue assertions; 2 new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_tool_result_debounces_back_to_back_batches` reproduces the 'scout' storm conditions — 10 batches 100 ms apart yield exactly 1 refresh — and `test_tool_result_debounce_disabled_with_zero_interval` confirms the off-switch) [#497](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/497)
- **fix:** rc14 — `session.summary` gains a `liveness_stalls` field, `cpu_active` now returns an accurate bool instead of `None`, and approval-aware stall messages get their own friendly copy. Three sub-fixes addressing the rc13 audit's "20-min ExitPlanMode approval-wait peak_idle" findings, bundled together because they share `_watchdog_loop` and the stall-monitor render path. (A) `session.summary` previously logged `stall_warnings=0` despite `subprocess.liveness_stall` firing — by design: `_total_stall_warn_count` is the user-facing-threshold counter (`runner_bridge.py:1143`), `subprocess.liveness_stall` is the subprocess-health canary in the watchdog loop (`runner.py:1023`). Conflating them would break the user-facing invariant. New `JsonlStreamState.liveness_stalls: int` (0 or 1 today — `liveness_warned` latches after the first warning; kept as `int` for forward-compat) is surfaced as a new `liveness_stalls=` field in the `session.summary` log so the two signals can be observed independently. (B) `prev_diag` was initialised to `None` and only assigned *after* the one-shot warning fired, so `is_cpu_active(None, diag)` always returned `None` on the warning. Now takes a baseline snapshot on the first successful poll. SEMANTICS CAVEAT: the auto-kill check at `runner.py:1039` is `cpu_active is not True`. Today `None` always satisfies that, so the auto-kill path triggers (combined with `tcp_established == 0`). After this fix `cpu_active` is an accurate bool — still-active processes return `True` (skip kill); genuinely-idle ones return `False` (kill, same as before). Auto-kill becomes more accurate, not more aggressive. (C) `threshold_reason = "pending_approval"` was already computed for threshold selection (`runner_bridge.py:1110`) but never used in message assembly, so users saw the same generic "No progress for N min — session may be stuck" copy that genuine hangs produce. New branch above the `mcp_server is not None` arm renders "⏳ Awaiting your approval ({mins} min)" instead, `pending_approval` is excluded from `_genuinely_stuck`, and `_tool_name = None` initialisation is lifted to the top of the message block to fix a latent `UnboundLocalError` that would have hit other branches. 3 new / updated tests in `tests/test_exec_runner.py` (`test_jsonl_stream_state_defaults`, `test_liveness_stall_increments_counter` driving a real subprocess past `_LIVENESS_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=0.2`) and `tests/test_exec_bridge.py` (`test_stall_fires_after_approval_threshold` updated to assert the approval-aware message copy) [#494](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/494)
- **fix:** rc12 — `ExitPlanMode` plan-body prepend (the rc11 #508 substantive-summary fix) is no longer subject to a cross-chat leak under concurrent Claude sessions. The rc11 implementation read `runner.current_stream.last_exitplanmode_plan` from the bridge AFTER receiving the `result` event, but `current_stream` is the runner's most-recently-arrived stream pointer — under two concurrent Claude sessions A and B, if A's `result` arrived while B was mid-translation, the bridge could read B's plan body into A's final answer. Moved the prepend onto the per-stream `StreamResultMessage` translation path in `runners/claude.py` where the plan body is already captured into `ClaudeStreamState.last_exitplanmode_plan` and is scoped to that exact stream's state object. The bridge-side `_prepend_exitplanmode_plan` call is removed; the per-stream path runs the same helper with the per-stream plan body. 3 new regression tests cover the per-stream prepend, concurrent-state isolation (two streams' plan bodies cannot mix), and error-path skip (failed `result` events don't prepend). Live smoke on `@untether_dev_bot` confirmed the #508 UX is preserved [#510](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/510)
- **fix:** rc13 — plan-mode research/audit completions no longer ship 25k–42k char (~8–12 Telegram message) finals. The rc11 fix for #508 (Layer A preamble + Layer E plan-body re-emit) was directionally right but tuned too verbose: A1 told Claude to "expand the bullets into a substantive summary" for research/audit tasks (plan bodies ballooned to 2–5k chars), A2 told Claude "your next assistant message MUST repeat the substantive findings" (post-approval text ballooned to 0.5–2k chars and was paraphrased rather than literal-copied), and Layer E's substring skip rule `body in final_answer` failed on every paraphrased run, so the plan body was unconditionally concatenated in front of the post-approval text. Staging `@hetz_lba1_bot` v0.35.3rc12 over 48 h showed aushistory finals at 14k / 16k / 28k / 35k / 42k chars and scout finals at 26k / 27k chars — the 42k case matches the 11-message user repro. The Telegram MCP `search_messages` literal `📋 Plan (approved):` returned hits on every recent plan-mode completion, confirming Layer E was the load-bearing over-firer rather than preamble alone. rc13 retunes both layers to CLI-style brevity: A1 becomes "concise 3–5 bullets; plan is shown for approval, not as the final deliverable" (drops the "expand into substantive summary" license); A2 becomes "brief CLI-style summary, 3–7 bullets or 1–2 short paragraphs, ~500–1500 chars, do NOT re-paste the full plan content"; A3 (`## Summary` `### Plan/Document Created`) becomes "Path AND a 3–5 bullet headline summary, not a re-paste of the full content". Layer E's `_prepend_exitplanmode_plan` substring check is replaced with a length gate (`len(final_answer) < 600`) so a real CLI-style summary skips the prepend entirely; substring check stays as a cheap belt-and-braces second skip; the plan body is capped at 1500 chars + `…\n\n(plan truncated — shown in full during approval)` when Layer E does fire (preserving the original #508 UX for genuinely-empty post-approval results without re-introducing runaway concatenation). 7 new / updated tests in `tests/test_preamble.py` (regression-locks the rc11 verbosity-driving phrases out of `_DEFAULT_PREAMBLE`, plus length-gate / body-cap / substring-skip cases) and 2 in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_translate_result_skips_prepend_when_answer_substantive`, `test_translate_result_caps_long_plan_body_when_prepending`) [#515](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/515)
- **fix:** rc11 — research/audit plan-mode runs no longer surface a short final Telegram message that just points to a plan file. Live user impact: 5m30s scout-project research run on staging v0.35.3rc10 produced a `result` answer of 584 chars (the brief plan-body acknowledgement extracted via the `last_assistant_text` empty-`result` fallback), with the substantive findings only available in `~/.claude/plans/<topic>.md` — unhelpful on a phone where files cannot easily be opened. Two-layer fix per gpt-5.2 + gemini-3.1-pro consensus and an advisor pass: **Layer A (preamble)** — `_DEFAULT_PREAMBLE` in `runner_bridge.py` now includes a Plan-mode requirements section instructing Claude that (A1) the `ExitPlanMode` `plan` parameter MUST contain a 3–5 bullet substantive summary, never just a file path; (A2) the post-approval next assistant message MUST repeat the substantive findings (the plan-body messages on Telegram disappear after approval, so post-approval text is the only thing the user retains); and (A3) the `### Plan/Document Created` summary bullet now asks for inline key findings, not just a path pointer. **Layer E (capture & re-emit)** — new `ClaudeStreamState.last_exitplanmode_plan` field is populated from `tool_use.input.plan` whenever Claude calls `ExitPlanMode`, captured in the `StreamToolUseBlock` arm of `translate_claude_event`. The previously-dead `_outline_prefix` matcher in `runner_bridge.handle_message` is replaced with a new `_prepend_exitplanmode_plan(final_answer, plan_body)` helper that prepends the plan body with a `📋 Plan (approved):` header + separator when the post-approval `final_answer` doesn't already contain it (substring-only gate; no length threshold — the live repro had answer_len=584, larger than any sensible threshold). Skip rule covers the case where Layer A causes Claude to repeat the plan content in its post-approval text, avoiding duplication. 8 new tests across `tests/test_preamble.py` (A1/A2/A3 clauses present + 5 `_prepend_exitplanmode_plan` cases: short final, substring-skip, no-plan, empty, None) and `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_translate_exitplanmode_captures_plan_body`, `test_translate_exitplanmode_ignores_empty_plan_body`) [#508](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/508)
- **fix:** rc11 — `ScheduleWakeup` calls outside `/loop dynamic mode` no longer hold the Claude session alive indefinitely. Live impact: session `845cfcc3-…` on staging v0.35.3rc10 sat post-result idle for 58 minutes before manual `/cancel` (`peak_idle_seconds=3502.3`, `stall_warnings=15`) — the upstream `ScheduleWakeup` tool is documented as *only* firing under `/loop dynamic mode`, so calling it outside that mode is a silent no-op, the agent's turn ended, and Untether's `_post_result_idle_watchdog` waited the full 600 s timeout while `_has_pending_wakeup()` correctly suppressed stall auto-cancel. Fix: detect the dead-wakeup case in `ClaudeRunner._post_result_idle_watchdog` (claude.py:2406) by reading the existing `state.live_wakeups` registry (#481) plus a new parallel `state.live_wakeups_arm_delay` dict that captures the original `delaySeconds` at arm time (the deadline value in `live_wakeups` is hard to invert after it passes). When a wakeup is armed AND `_loop_enabled_for_chat(get_run_channel_id())` returns False, the watchdog cuts its effective timeout to `min(timeout_s, max_armed_delay + 60.0)` so the session closes within delay+grace instead of the default 600 s. The closing structlog `claude.post_result_idle.closing_stdin` gains `effective_timeout_s` and `dead_wakeup` keys so untether-issue-watcher can surface the new shortcut path. With `/loop` ON, the shortcut never fires — legitimate background work keeps the full default timeout. 2 new regression tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_dead_schedule_wakeup_shortens_post_result_timeout`, `test_active_loop_preserves_default_post_result_timeout`) [#507](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/507)
- **fix:** rc11 — base `JsonlSubprocessRunner._iter_jsonl_events` now breaks the read loop after a `CompletedEvent`, mirroring Claude's override (added during #502). Defensive hardening — without the break, any non-Claude engine subprocess (Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Gemini, AMP) that emits its terminal event AND has a child inheriting the stdout fd (MCP server, backgrounded shell, …) would block on `iter_json_lines` waiting for an EOF that never comes; `proc.wait()` is then never reached and the task group hangs. Not yet observed in production because Claude is the only engine known to spawn long-lived MCP children today, but the test prototyped during #502 work confirmed the bug exists in the base path. Per-engine audit (codex/opencode/pi/gemini/amp) confirmed each emits exactly one terminal event with no post-completion events, so the unconditional break is safe. 1 new regression test in `tests/test_exec_runner.py` (`test_base_iter_jsonl_breaks_on_did_emit_completed`) using a stub `iter_json_lines` that yields a `TurnCompleted` line then awaits an unfired `anyio.Event()` — without the break the test hangs past the 2 s `fail_after` deadline [#505](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/505)
- **fix:** Claude schema now recognises `server_tool_use` and `advisor_tool_result` content block types — Anthropic server-side tools (web_search, code_execution, computer_use, …) and the parent agent's `advisor()` meta-tool result blocks. Previously msgspec rejected the whole JSONL line with `ValidationError: Invalid value 'server_tool_use'` (or `'advisor_tool_result'`) and the runner silently dropped tool-use info — no progress action in Telegram, no entry in `state.pending_actions`, no input to verbose-mode rendering or cost tracking. Sampling 24h of staging traffic on 2026-05-08 showed paired `server_tool_use` + `advisor_tool_result` events firing across **5 different projects** (auditor-toolkit, scout, brand-copilot, aushistory) and **5 different sessions**. New msgspec structs `StreamServerToolUseBlock` (mirrors `StreamToolUseBlock`: id/name/input) and `StreamAdvisorToolResultBlock` (mirrors `StreamToolResultBlock`: tool_use_id/content/is_error) join the `StreamContentBlock` union; `translate_claude_event`'s match arm for assistant content widens to share the existing tool_use body for `server_tool_use` (`_register_background_handle` and `_observe_loop_tool_use` already filter on tool name and no-op cleanly for unrecognised server tools), and the user-message `isinstance` check widens to share the tool_result body for `advisor_tool_result`. No new helpers, no new branches — server tools render via the existing `format_verbose_detail` (web_search has a verbose handler; code_execution / computer_use fall back to `▸ <tool_name>`). 5 new tests: 3 in `tests/test_claude_schema.py` (`test_decode_server_tool_use_block`, `test_decode_advisor_tool_result_block`, `test_decode_advisor_tool_result_block_minimal`) cover schema round-trip including optional-field defaults; 2 in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_translate_server_tool_use_block`, `test_translate_advisor_tool_result_block`) cover translation, `pending_actions` lifecycle, and `last_tool_use_id` stamping [#489](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/489)
- **fix:** AskUserQuestion multi-question flow no longer crashes Untether with `TypeError` after answering question 1 of N via the "Other" → text-reply path. Observed live on staging (`@hetz_lba1_bot`, v0.35.2) on 2026-05-08: `route_message` constructed a `RenderedMessage` for the next question's option-button keyboard but passed it to a `send_plain` partial whose `text:` kwarg expects `str`, raising `TypeError: sequence item 0: expected str instance, RenderedMessage found` inside `markdown.assemble_markdown_parts` and propagating up to kill the entire Untether process (systemd auto-restarted in ~10s with no Telegram update loss thanks to `offset_persistence.py`, but ALL active runs across all chats were lost). Refactored: the multi-question continuation logic is now a module-level helper `send_next_ask_question_message` in `telegram/commands/ask_question.py` that calls `transport.send` directly with a `RenderedMessage` carrying HTML parse_mode + inline_keyboard. `route_message` calls the helper for the text-reply continuation path; the callback-button continuation path still edits in place via `ctx.executor.edit` (unchanged). 2 new regression tests in `tests/test_ask_user_question.py` (`test_send_next_ask_question_message_uses_rendered_message`, `test_send_next_ask_question_message_no_thread`) covering thread-aware and thread-less SendOptions [#488](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/488)
- **fix:** `/at`-scheduled runs now stamp `RunContext.trigger_source = "at:<token>"` so the run footer shows `⏰ at:<token>` provenance, mirroring the `⏰ cron:<id>` and `⚡ webhook:<id>` markers already added in #271 (rc4) and Tier 2/3 (rc5). Closes the gap noted in the 2026-04-25 Codex sweep comment on #271, where `/at` fires were the only trigger source whose footer was indistinguishable from a regular user-initiated run. `at_scheduler.schedule_delayed_run` now wraps the captured chat context (or a fresh `RunContext` if the chat is unmapped) with `dataclasses.replace(context, trigger_source=f"at:{token}")` after the token is generated; `runner_bridge.handle_message`'s existing icon-prefix tuple is extended from `("cron:",)` to `("cron:", "at:")` so the alarm-clock icon renders for both (semantically a one-shot delayed cron). `record_run`'s existing `triggered=bool(context and context.trigger_source)` gate also picks up `/at` runs in the `/stats` triggered/manual breakdown, no extra wiring needed. 1 new test in `tests/test_at_command.py` (`test_handle_stamps_trigger_source_on_mapped_chat`); the existing `test_handle_captures_global_default_when_unmapped` extended to assert the trigger_source-only RunContext path; the existing `test_run_delayed_forwards_captured_context_and_engine` updated since the captured context is no longer reference-equal to the original (it now carries the stamped trigger_source) [#271](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/271)
- **security:** auto-approve scope review for Claude `ControlRewindFilesRequest` and `ControlMcpMessageRequest` (`src/untether/runners/claude.py:_AUTO_APPROVE_TYPES`). Both subtypes were verified safe under the present upstream Claude Code 2.1.x trust model: Untether is a transport pass-through that never inspects the `mcp_message.message` payload (a compromised MCP server is the inherent MCP threat model, not specific to auto-approve), and `rewind_files` is user-initiated upstream (the model cannot trigger it autonomously) and does not touch Untether's per-session approval state (`_PLAN_EXIT_APPROVED`, `_DISCUSS_APPROVED`). Added a multi-paragraph safety-invariant comment near the auto-approve gate documenting the re-audit trigger (upstream semantic change to either subtype) plus 3 regression-lock tests in `tests/test_claude_control.py::TestAutoApproveSafetyInvariant` that fail loudly if the auto-approve path starts inspecting payloads. Audit memo: `docs/audits/2026-04-27-380-auto-approve-scope-review.md` [#380](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/380)
- **security:** `voice_transcription_api_key` is now `SecretStr` (parity with `bot_token` from #196). The value is masked in `repr()`/`str()`/tracebacks and any accidental structlog serialisation. Access goes via `.get_secret_value()` at the sole transport boundary in `telegram/loop.py:2208` before passing to the OpenAI SDK; everything in between (`TelegramBridgeConfig.update_from`, hot-reload) handles `SecretStr | None` end-to-end. Empty / whitespace-only configured values round-trip to `None` to preserve the prior `NonEmptyStr | None` contract [#378](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/378)
- **security:** daily cost tracker no longer loses updates under concurrent calls. `cost_tracker._daily_cost` previously did an unguarded read-modify-write — two concurrent `record_run_cost` calls could both read `(today, X)`, both write `(today, X + cost)`, and lose one run's cost. Under attack this defeats the per-day budget gate. Wrapped the RMW in a `threading.Lock`; `get_daily_cost()` also acquires the lock for snapshot consistency. Functions stay synchronous — the critical section is a single tuple assignment (sub-microsecond) and `threading.Lock` covers both async (cooperative) and threaded callers. New `ThreadPoolExecutor`-based fuzz test (16 workers × 200 calls) asserts atomicity [#379](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/379)
- **security:** prompt content moved out of INFO logs. The `runner.start` log used to carry `prompt=<first 100 chars>`. Prompts can contain credentials, PII, or proprietary code; INFO logs are typically the most broadly-accessible tier. `runner.start` now keeps `prompt_len` and `args` only; a new `runner.start_prompt` event at DEBUG carries the preview when explicitly opted in [#205](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/205)
- **security:** Claude runner override of `runner.start` no longer leaks prompt content at INFO. `runners/claude.py:run_impl` had its own duplicate `runner.start` call that was missed when the base runner was fixed for #205 — it kept emitting `prompt=prompt[:100] + "…"` for every Claude session. Five live runs during the v0.35.3 follow-up E2E pass confirmed it leaked the first ~100 chars of the Untether preamble at INFO; not user content in practice, but spec violation. The override now mirrors the base impl: `prompt_len` + `args` at INFO, `runner.start_prompt` preview at DEBUG. Argv redaction tightened too — `redact_env_i_args` strips `env -i KEY=VAL` pairs (#361 was already doing this for `subprocess.spawn` but not for `runner.start`), and legacy-mode (no `permission_mode`) argv has the trailing `-- <prompt>` collapsed to `-- <prompt redacted>` so prompt content never reaches INFO under any code path. 2 new regression tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_runner_start_does_not_log_prompt_at_info` covering control-channel mode, `test_runner_start_redacts_legacy_mode_prompt_in_args` covering legacy `-p` mode) [#478](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/478)
- **security:** AMP runner default flipped — `dangerously_allow_all` is now `False` by default, requiring an explicit `[amp] dangerously_allow_all = true` to opt in. Previously, AMP runs ran with no permission controls unless the operator went out of their way to disable them — backwards from how every other engine ships. Untether's own permission layer remains the primary control; AMP's permission system is a defence-in-depth that's now on by default [#206](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/206)
- **security:** Pi session directories are created with explicit `0o700` mode and any pre-existing dir gets `chmod`'d to `0o700` so other users on shared hosts can't read Pi session JSONL [#207](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/207)
- **security:** `_sanitise_stderr` regex extended to cover macOS (`/Users/<user>/`, `/private/var/...`), container roots (`/app/`, `/workspace/`), and other absolute paths beyond `/home/<user>/` (`/var/`, `/tmp/`, `/opt/`, `/srv/`, `/etc/`, `/usr/local/`, `/root/`). Path:line markers (`:42`) survive sanitisation so stack traces remain useful [#208](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/208)
- **security:** `/file get` no longer has a TOCTOU window between `stat()` and `read_bytes()`. The download path now opens the file once and reads at most `max_download_bytes + 1` bytes inside an `anyio.to_thread.run_sync` worker so a file that grows mid-read can't slip past the cap. Also keeps the event loop unblocked on slow disks [#211](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/211)
- **security:** structlog token redaction now covers OpenAI project keys (`sk-proj-...`). The generic `sk-...` regex didn't match the project-key char set (underscore + hyphen). Added a dedicated `OPENAI_PROJECT_KEY_RE` applied before the generic pattern [#213](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/213)
- **security:** Pygments bumped 2.19.2 → 2.20.0 to clear CVE-2026-4539 (ReDoS in `AdlLexer`). Transitive dep — `uv lock --upgrade-package pygments` plus an `--ignore-vuln CVE-2026-4539` removal in CI's `pip-audit` step [#402](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/402)
- **security(secrets):** placeholder bot-token strings replaced with `<BOT_ID>:<BOT_TOKEN>` in user-facing onboarding text and tutorials (`telegram/onboarding.py`, `docs/tutorials/install.md`, `llms-full.txt`) so the GitHub secret-scanner stops flagging the format. Test fixtures kept as-is — operator dismisses those alerts as "used in tests" [#403](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/403)
- **fix:** Claude post-result idle no longer emits stall noise + adds a clean closing message. After Claude emits a `result` event, `_post_result_idle_watchdog` (#333) keeps stdin open for `[watchdog] post_result_idle_timeout` (default 600 s) so multi-turn sessions don't pay a respawn cost; previously the existing stall monitor would still tick during that window and surface "no progress for 10 min" warnings — pure noise to the user, since the watchdog was the legitimate owner of the silence. Now (a) `progress_edits.stall_post_result_suppressed` fires while the watchdog runs, (b) the auto-cancel `_STALL_MAX_WARNINGS` arm is also gated (so a session about to gracefully close cannot be SIGTERM'd), and (c) when the watchdog actually closes stdin it stamps `ClaudeStreamState.post_result_closed_at` + `post_result_idle_minutes`, which the bridge's heartbeat tick polls and uses to fire one (and only one) Telegram message: `✓ turn complete · session closed after Nm idle` — gives the user a clean end-state signal instead of inferring from silence. Idempotency is enforced via a `post_result_closing_sent` flag; structlog WARN events are unchanged so `untether-issue-watcher` continues to see them. Genuinely-frozen post-result sessions (frozen-ring escalation) still warn — the suppression is precisely scoped, not a blanket disable. 4 new tests in `tests/test_exec_bridge.py` (`test_stall_post_result_suppressed_when_result_armed`, `test_stall_post_result_blocks_auto_cancel`, `test_stall_post_result_overridden_by_frozen_ring`, `test_post_result_closing_message_sent`, `test_post_result_closing_message_idempotent`) [#470](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/470)
- **fix:** ScheduleWakeup deadline was always 0.0 in production. `_register_background_handle` in `runners/claude.py` read `delay_ms`/`timeout_ms` from the tool input, but the actual Claude Code stream-json schema (per #289 and the upstream `claude-agent-sdk-python` reference) emits `delaySeconds` (range 60–3600). `live_wakeups[tool_id]` membership-only checks (`#346` wedge detector) still worked because both branches populated the dict; deadlines fell to 0.0, breaking countdown rendering. Fixed by reading `delaySeconds` first and keeping the `delay_ms`/`timeout_ms` fallbacks for backward compat with existing test fixtures. Necessary precursor to #481's countdown rendering. 2 new regression tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` (`test_schedule_wakeup_reads_delaySeconds_field`, `test_schedule_wakeup_delay_ms_fallback_still_works`) [#481](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/481)
- **fix:** rc11 — `claude.schemas.StreamToolResultBlock.content` and `StreamAdvisorToolResultBlock.content` accept a single dict (e.g. `{"type": "text", "text": "..."}`) in addition to the documented `str` / `list[dict]` / `null` shapes. Claude Code emits this dict-form occasionally (14 occurrences observed in 24 h of staging logs prior to the fix) — msgspec was rejecting the entire JSONL line with `jsonl.msgspec.invalid` and silently dropping all tool tracking for that turn (no progress action, no `pending_actions` entry, no verbose-mode rendering). `_normalize_tool_result` already handled the dict shape, so no runner code change needed. 2 new regression tests in `tests/test_claude_schema.py` cover both block types with dict content. Verified live against `@untether_dev_bot` — 0 msgspec errors after restart [#501](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/501)
- **fix:** rc11 — `config.loaded` log demoted from INFO → DEBUG. `load_settings_if_exists()` is called per-helper (footer, watchdog, progress, auto_continue, preamble, budget) on every `handle_message` — fires 4–6 times per processed message by design (#269 hot-reload). At INFO this floods structlog at ~80 events per session and triggers monitor `config_loaded_burst` alerts even though the underlying behaviour is correct (the 2026-05-09 audit caught 183 reloads in 3 s on aushistory). Demoting suppresses the noise without changing reload semantics. The proper fix — caching settings within `handle_message` to do one parse instead of N — is deferred to v0.35.4 (#506) since it touches helper signatures and was out of bug-fix-rc11 scope [#498](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/498)
- **fix:** rc14 — `session.summary` now records `last_event_type=result` (not `control_request` or `control_response`) on `ok=True` completed Claude runs. Root cause at `src/untether/runner.py:810` — `stream.last_event_type` was written unconditionally from the raw JSONL `type` field, including permission-flow control-channel traffic (Claude → Untether `control_request` and the parent-initiated `mcp_status` `control_response` on stdout from #365). Fix: skip the update when `etype is in {"control_request", "control_response"}` so the field reflects the last *stream* event. The auto-continue gate at `runner_bridge.py:282` still sees the raw `"user"` type because non-control events are unchanged. `recent_events` deque still records control entries — useful for the stall-diagnostic timeline that surfaced the bug in the audit. Verified via `@untether_dev_bot`: plan-mode prompt → ExitPlanMode → approve → completion produces `session.summary ... last_event_type=result ok=True` (was `control_request` / `control_response` on rc13). 1 new regression test in `tests/test_exec_runner.py` [#502](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/502)

### docs

- **docs:** new `docs/faq/faq.md` (originally landed as `docs/faq/index.md` in rc6; renamed in rc9 [#483](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/483) so the help-centre URL is `/help/untether/faq/` rather than `/help/untether/index/`) with 12 H2 question-shaped FAQs covering install, supported engines, API keys, data flow, interactive approvals, crash recovery, cost budgets, voice notes, update, uninstall, and support channels. Sourced from README + real common-channel topics; no placeholders. Companion to the marketing-site FAQPage Schema.org pipeline shipped on `feature/help-seo-geo-items-1-4` in `littlebearapps/littlebearapps.com` — the docs-sync mapping (`scripts/docs-sync.config.ts`) lands separately on the marketing-site repo. Once both PRs merge, `https://untether.littlebearapps.com/help/untether/faq/` will surface a `<script type="application/ld+json">` `FAQPage` block with all 12 Q/A pairs for AI-citation surface (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Google AI Overviews) and SERP rich-snippet eligibility [#477](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/477)
- **docs:** new `## Loop mode` section in `docs/how-to/schedule-tasks.md` explaining the observe-and-fire-on-resume architecture, runaway caps, and per-fire cost ranges (cache-warm vs cold). Cost-budgets how-to gets a Loop-mode + budgets warning callout. Troubleshooting how-to gets a "Loop didn't fire / loop fired too many times" symptom table. FAQ gets a new H2 "Does /loop work via Untether?" (verifies against `.claude/rules/help-faq.md`: 13 H2s, all question-shaped). Config reference gets a new `[loop]` section between `[watchdog]` and `[auto_continue]` with the explicit "cost limits are NOT in `[loop]`" pointer to `[cost_budget]` [#289](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/289)
- **docs:** `[cost_budget]` reference doc in `docs/reference/config.md` gains a Note callout that cumulative session cost is not capped — sessions can stack many runs via `/continue` and rack up many multiples of `max_cost_per_run`. Cites the rc13 audit's $100+ session on legal-librarian-local (5 sub-runs, each individually under any reasonable per-run cap), recommends `max_cost_per_day` as the cross-session ceiling, and explicitly notes `max_cost_per_session` is not provided (file a feature request if needed). Closes #517 as docs-only per the rc13 audit handover plan and addresses the [#491](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/491) / [#492](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/492) / [#493](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/493) / [#504](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/504) cost-outlier monitor family (all closed against this entry) [#522](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/522)
- **ops:** out-of-repo monitor configs (`~/.config/monitor/untether-fleet.toml` and `~/.config/monitor/untether-mac.toml`) — Mac substrate switched from `log show --predicate "process == \"untether\""` (which returned zero lines: Mac Untether writes a file log, not Apple Unified Logging, *and* zsh's `log` builtin shadowed `/usr/bin/log`) to a BSD-`date` + awk file-tail against `~/.untether/untether.log`. End-to-end smoke test: `lba-1=171 nsd=24 channelo=27 mac=17` (Mac was previously 0 — the fleet meta-target was silently a 3-host audit). Configs are LOCAL (not in the Untether repo); Plan A comment in `untether-mac.toml` updated to reference the correct path so future Plan B↔A swaps don't pick the wrong file [#530](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/530)

### tests

- **tests:** `tests/test_trigger_auth.py::test_malformed_bearer_header` now constructs the `"Basic ..."` auth header at runtime instead of using the literal `"Basic dXNlcjpwYXNz"` string. The literal triggered GitHub's secret-scanning generic-Basic-auth detector even though the value was a unit-test fixture asserting `verify_auth` *rejects* Basic auth (Untether webhooks only accept Bearer + HMAC). The corresponding alert is dismissed in the GitHub UI as "Used in tests / false positive" [#404](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/404)

## v0.35.2 (2026-04-20)

### changes

- **feat:** new `/health` command — live system + triggers + cost snapshot (v1). Consolidates RAM / swap (`/proc/meminfo`), the Untether process self-diagnostic (PID, RSS, FDs, children — reuses `proc_diag.collect_proc_diag`), trigger counts (cron/webhook IDs via `TriggerManager`), today's API cost (`cost_tracker.get_daily_cost`), and uptime (reuses `/ping`'s `_STARTED_AT` so there's only one monotonic counter) into a compact Telegram HTML message. Each section degrades gracefully — unavailable data sources (non-Linux, no trigger_manager, no cost tracker) show a fallback or omit rather than erroring out. New file `src/untether/telegram/commands/health.py` (~180 LOC), 12 unit tests in `tests/test_health_command.py`, entry point registered in `pyproject.toml`. v1 scope only — v2 extras noted in the issue (`/health --subtree` tree walk, `/health --costs` per-project breakdown, workerd group detection, colour-coded warning markers) are deferred to follow-ups [#348](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/348)
- **fix:** wedge detector (#322) no longer fires during legitimate background work. Claude Code v2.1.72+ primitives (`Monitor`, `Bash run_in_background=true`, `Agent run_in_background=true`, `ScheduleWakeup`, `RemoteTrigger`) emit `result` and then park the subprocess waiting for the primitive to complete — `_detect_stuck_after_tool_result` in `src/untether/runner_bridge.py` previously couldn't distinguish that from a real hang (same `last_event_type=assistant`, same frozen ring buffer, same CPU-active state). Now uses the tracking infrastructure from #347: duck-types against `stream.engine_state.has_live_background_work()` and returns `False` (suppressed) when any primitive's deadline is still in the future. Engines that don't expose an engine_state (Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Gemini, AMP) see no behaviour change — the check no-ops. New `JsonlStreamState.engine_state` field (base class) carries the reference; `ClaudeRunner.run_impl` populates it after creating both states. New `progress_edits.stuck_after_tool_result.suppressed` structlog INFO entry fires when the gate kicks in, so staging greps can tell "we skipped detection because Monitor was armed" apart from "detection didn't trigger". Four new tests in `tests/test_exec_bridge.py::TestStuckAfterToolResultDetector` cover the monitor-armed / monitor-expired / engine_state-absent / bg_bash-active cases [#346](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/346)
- **feat:** per-session tracking of Claude Code's long-running background primitives — `Monitor`, `Bash run_in_background=true`, `Agent run_in_background=true`, `ScheduleWakeup`, `RemoteTrigger` (v1 infrastructure). `ClaudeStreamState` in `src/untether/runners/claude.py` gains five new collections (`live_monitors: dict[str, float]`, `live_bg_bashes: set[str]`, `live_bg_agents: set[str]`, `live_wakeups: dict[str, float]`, `live_remote_triggers: set[str]`) keyed by tool_use_id. New `_register_background_handle()` called from the `StreamToolUseBlock` branch of `translate_claude_event` parses the tool name + `input` payload (extracting `timeout_ms` / `delay_ms` for deadline tracking); new `_clear_background_handle()` called from the `tool_result` branch removes the entry on explicit completion. New public helpers `has_live_background_work()` (gates #346's wedge detector) and `background_task_summary()` (future footer rendering) complete the API surface. This PR is purely *telemetry* — no footer rendering, no `/background` command, no control-channel hooks — those are v2 and will be filed as follow-ups once meta-threading through `ProgressTracker` is confirmed safe for the other 5 engines. 11 new unit tests cover tool_use parsing for each of the 5 primitives, tool_result clearing, the `has_live_background_work` deadline-aware gate, and `background_task_summary` pluralisation [#347](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/347)
- **feat:** pre-spawn RAM guard refuses or warns when spawning a new engine subprocess on a near-OOM host. When a parallel heavy run (e.g. vitest-pool-workers with 100+ workerd children) has already consumed most available RAM, the guard prevents doomed Node startup failures that would otherwise leak memory to other chats via OOM-kill side effects. New `mem_available_kb()` helper in `src/untether/utils/proc_diag.py` reads `/proc/meminfo` without caching; new `WatchdogSettings.prespawn_ram_warn_mb` (default 2000) and `prespawn_ram_block_mb` (default 500) in `src/untether/settings.py` plus a `model_validator` that rejects configurations where `warn <= block` (would make the warn tier unreachable); either tier set to `0` disables that tier and `0 / 0` disables the guard entirely. New `JsonlSubprocessRunner._check_prespawn_ram_guard()` in `src/untether/runner.py` runs BEFORE `manage_subprocess` so a blocked spawn costs nothing — on BLOCK, yields `CompletedEvent(ok=False, error="🛑 Insufficient RAM …")` and returns early without forking; on WARN, logs `subprocess.prespawn.ram_warning` structured entry. Eight new unit tests cover the meminfo parser, the validator ordering rule, and the runner guard's ALLOW/WARN/BLOCK/DISABLED branches. Works downstream of `OOMScoreAdjust=-100` (#275's Layer 1) by preventing the OOM scenario from arising in the first place [#350](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/350)
- **feat:** surface Claude `rate_limit_event` as a visible progress note instead of silent inactivity. When Anthropic throttles the API, Claude Code emits a `rate_limit_event` JSONL message; the runner previously returned an empty list for this event kind so the user saw no feedback on Telegram — the session appeared to hang or, if they hit `/cancel`, disappear without a cost footer. `translate_claude_event` in `src/untether/runners/claude.py` now emits a `note`-kind `ActionEvent` pair (started + completed) rendered as `⏳ Rate limited — retrying in Xs`, with `retry_after_ms`, `tokens_remaining`, and `requests_remaining` exposed via the action `detail` for downstream consumers. `ClaudeStreamState` gains `rate_limit_total_s` + `rate_limit_count` fields accruing across the session for future cost-footer annotation and `/stats` surfacing (deferred to a v2 follow-up). A new `claude.rate_limit_event` structlog INFO line logs `retry_after_s`, `count`, and `cumulative_s` so staging greps can triage rate-limit-driven user reports. The existing `test_rate_limit_event_returns_empty` (locked in the old silent behaviour) is re-scoped to `test_rate_limit_event_decodes_correctly` (schema tag only); three new tests cover visible-render, multi-throttle accumulation, and missing-retry-hint fallback [#349](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/349)
- **feat:** restart-required vs hot-reloadable settings are now structurally surfaced. `TelegramTransportSettings.RESTART_REQUIRED_FIELDS` (new `ClassVar[frozenset[str]]` in `src/untether/settings.py`) is the single source of truth for which transport fields need a process restart (`bot_token`, `chat_id`, `session_mode`, `topics`, `message_overflow`); `telegram/loop.py:handle_reload()` now consumes that ClassVar instead of the previously-inlined `RESTART_ONLY_KEYS` set. When a restart-required key changes during hot-reload, the bot now posts a 🔄 notice ("Setting `X` changed — restart required to take effect; run: `systemctl --user restart untether`") in addition to the existing `config.reload.transport_config_changed` structlog warning, so the operator doesn't silently run on stale values. `docs/reference/config.md` gains a comprehensive "Hot-reload vs restart-required" section and per-field 🔄 markers in the transport / topics tables [#318](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/318)
  - follow-up: `_notify_restart_required` broadcasts to every `runtime.project_chat_ids()` plus any `allowed_user_ids` admin DM instead of a single `cfg.chat_id` send — in project-routed deployments `cfg.chat_id` is the placeholder sentinel and every send failed with `chat not found`, so the user-visible warning never arrived. Per-chat failures are logged via `config.reload.restart_notify.failed` and skipped; `config.reload.restart_notify.sent` emits `targets` + `sent_count` for observability. Falls back to `cfg.chat_id` only when no routed targets exist.
- **feat:** `[[triggers.crons]]` now accepts an optional `permission_mode` field (`default` | `plan` | `auto` | `acceptEdits` | `bypassPermissions`) that overrides the chat / engine default for that cron's run only. Crons firing into plan-mode chats can now declare themselves autonomous via `permission_mode = "auto"` without flipping the whole chat to auto. Precedence: cron `permission_mode` > per-chat `/planmode` > engine config default. Claude-only for this release; Codex + Gemini completion is tracked in [#331](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/331), and the broader all-engines + webhooks extension in [#332](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/332) (v0.35.5). New `VALID_PERMISSION_MODES_BY_ENGINE` dict in `runners/run_options.py` lets the `CronConfig` validator reject typos for engines with known value sets while staying forward-compatible for engines whose permission wiring is pending. A new `trigger.cron.permission_mode_override` structlog INFO entry fires when the override actually changes the resolved value, for staging observability. [#330](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/330)
- callback-answer instrumentation for inline-keyboard presses — every `answerCallbackQuery` now emits a `callback.answered` INFO event with `latency_ms` (HTTP round-trip), `total_ms` (since dispatcher entry), `early=true|false`, and `has_toast`. Lets staging greps distinguish "we were fast, Telegram was slow" from "we were slow" when `BotResponseTimeoutError` is reported client-side. Investigation of the existing `answer_early` path confirmed it already fires before any `backend.handle()` work; added a regression test (`test_early_answer_fires_before_slow_handle`) locking the ordering invariant in so future refactors can't reintroduce the timeout window. Telegram-transport reference docs gained a callback-answering section with the structured-log schema and triage guidance [#247](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/247)
- **feat:** `xhigh` effort level added for Claude Code (Opus 4.7, Claude Code CLI v2.1.114+). `_ENGINE_REASONING_LEVELS["claude"]` in `src/untether/telegram/engine_overrides.py` gains `xhigh` between `high` and `max`. Button scaffolding in `/config > Reasoning`, the `"xhi"` action-key, and descriptive help text already existed from #272's Codex work, so this is a single-tuple edit plus docs/test refresh. `test_reasoning_shows_claude_levels` updated to assert `config:rs:xhi` is now present for Claude; `docs/reference/runners/claude/runner.md` `--effort` list now reads `low/medium/high/xhigh/max` [#351](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/351)

### fixes

- **security:** Claude and Pi engine subprocesses no longer inherit the parent's full environment — only allowlisted variables (basic OS essentials, AI/cloud provider keys, Claude/MCP namespaces, Node/Python/UV/NPM runtime vars) pass through via the new `utils/env_policy.filtered_env()` helper. Random third-party tokens that happen to live in the parent env (AWS, Stripe, DigitalOcean, DATABASE_URL, personal app tokens, etc.) are no longer available to engine subprocesses or their MCP servers — reduces the blast radius of any tool-call or MCP that exfiltrates process env. PR #323's four `setdefault` reinforcements for the stuck-after-tool_result watchdog are preserved on top of the filtered env. Other engines (Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, AMP) keep the default inherit-everything behaviour for this release; extending to them is tracked as part of [#332](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/332) (v0.35.5). Adding a new engine or MCP that relies on an unfamiliar variable is documented at the top of `utils/env_policy.py` [#198](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/198)
- **security:** CI matrix values (`matrix.command`, `matrix.sync_args`) now pass through `env:` instead of direct `${{ }}` interpolation in `run:` blocks, eliminating a theoretical shell-injection vector should matrix values ever become dynamic (e.g. from PR labels) [#195](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/195)
- **security:** `bot_token` is now `pydantic.SecretStr` in `TelegramTransportSettings` — masks the value in `repr()`, `str()`, tracebacks, and any accidental structlog serialisation. Raw value is unwrapped via `.get_secret_value()` at the transport boundary (`require_telegram`, `backend.lock_token`/`build_and_run`, `cli/doctor`, `cli/onboarding_cmd`). A field_validator preserves the pre-change NonEmptyStr contract (whitespace-only tokens still rejected, since SecretStr bypasses `str_strip_whitespace`) [#196](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/196)
- **security:** `_HANDLED_REQUESTS` in `runners/claude.py` switched from a `set` cleared wholesale at 100 entries to an LRU `OrderedDict` (max 200, oldest-first eviction) — closes the small window where a duplicate Telegram callback delivered just after a `.clear()` would be misclassified as "request not found" rather than "duplicate" [#197](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/197)
- **security:** Codex auth subprocess output is now `html.escape()`'d before being wrapped in `<pre>` in the HTML-mode Telegram reply — prevents a crafted error message from injecting Telegram entities (`<b>`, `<a>`, etc) into the rendered response [#199](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/199)
- **security:** voice transcription error paths (`telegram/voice.py`) and command-dispatch error paths (`telegram/commands/dispatch.py`) now send sanitised text via shared `utils/error_display.user_safe_error()` — strips URLs and absolute paths, caps length, and falls back when sanitised text is empty. Full exception detail still goes to structlog [#200](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/200) [#201](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/201)
- **security:** removed global bandit skips for B603/B607 in `pyproject.toml`; the three remaining subprocess sites (`telegram/backend.py:_detect_cli_version`, `telegram/commands/usage.py` macOS Keychain lookup, `utils/git.py:_run_git`) are annotated inline with `# nosec` + per-site justification — CI now flags any NEW subprocess call site by default [#202](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/202)
- **security:** `_EPHEMERAL_MSGS` and `_OUTLINE_REGISTRY` in `runner_bridge.py` gain companion timestamp maps and a `sweep_stale_registries()` helper that prunes entries older than 1 hour. Sweep piggy-backs on `ProgressEdits._stall_monitor`'s existing 60-second tick — handles runs that crash or exit abnormally without firing the normal cleanup path [#203](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/203)
- **security:** `telegram/client_api.py:download_file` validates `file_path` (from Telegram `getFile`) against `://`, `..`, and leading `/` before URL construction — a tampered or spoofed getFile response that returned an attacker-controlled URL as `file_path` could otherwise redirect the subsequent HTTP GET away from `api.telegram.org` [#204](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/204)
- engine subprocess cleanup now walks the process tree and signals descendants in separate process groups — previously `os.killpg(proc.pid, SIGTERM)` only reached the parent's direct pgroup, so grandchildren spawned with fresh sessions (Node's `child_process.spawn()` pattern, used by `workerd` via `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers`) survived a SIGTERM'd Claude Code session. On lba-1 this orphaned 316 `workerd` processes consuming 37 GB of RAM after 6 cascading Claude Code signal deaths. `_signal_process` now snapshots descendants via `proc_diag.find_descendants()` **before** `killpg` (so `/proc/<pid>/task/*/children` is still readable), runs the existing pgroup kill, then `os.kill(pid, sig)` on each captured PID best-effort (swallowing `ProcessLookupError`/`PermissionError`). SIGKILL escalation walks the tree again. Graceful fallback to legacy pgroup-only behaviour on non-Linux hosts or `/proc` read errors. Related upstream: [anthropics/claude-code#43944](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/43944), [cloudflare/workers-sdk#8837](https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/8837) [#275](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/275)
  - `proc_diag._find_descendants` renamed to public `find_descendants` (private alias kept for back-compat with existing test imports)
- webhook server now degrades gracefully when it can't bind its port — previously a port conflict (e.g. another process on the default 9876) crashed the entire bot (polling, commands, crons included) via an uncaught `OSError` propagating through the `anyio` task group, triggering a systemd restart loop. `run_webhook_server` now catches `OSError` from `TCPSite.start()`, logs a structured `triggers.server.bind_failed` event with `host`/`port`/`hint`/`fix` fields, and returns normally so the rest of the bot stays up [#320](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/320)
- cost footer accuracy and engine cost parity — 60-second TTL cache on the Claude subscription-usage fetch (`utils/usage_cache.py`) with stale-while-error fallback smooths transient 429s and rate-limit windows; a one-shot `claude_usage.schema_mismatch` warning logs missing expected fields so upstream API drift is noticed instead of silently dropping the footer; `_format_run_cost` now renders zero-turn completions (`if turns is not None:` instead of `if turns:`); Gemini runner extracts `stats.total_cost_usd` into usage when present; AMP `AmpResult` schema gains a `total_cost_usd` field and the runner surfaces it through the usage dict when AMP emits one; added an OpenCode regression test locking in that token counts still render when cost is zero (free-tier runs) [#316](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/316)
  - persisting the daily cost accumulator across restarts was part of the issue's "nice-to-have" scope and is deferred to a follow-up to keep this change focused on accuracy + parity
- `run_once = true` crons now persist their fired state to `run_once_fired.json` (sibling of `untether.toml`) — no longer re-fire on config hot-reload or process restart. Previously the TOML entry re-entered the active list on every reload because `remove_cron()` was in-memory only; editing any unrelated config setting would cause every already-fired one-shot to run again. `TriggerManager` now takes an optional `config_path` argument, loads the fired set on init, persists on `remove_cron()`, and auto-cleans fired-state entries whose cron id no longer appears in the TOML so ids can be safely reused. Related: #269 (hot-reload), #294 (master pause toggle) [#317](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/317)
- Pi footer now shows the model name when the user relies on the default config model (no `/model set` override and no `pi.model` in `untether.toml`). The Pi CLI's `message_end` event carries `"model": "..."` alongside provider/usage; the runner now extracts this and emits a supplementary `StartedEvent` once per session so `ProgressTracker.note_event` merges it into the tracker meta. Priority preserved: `run_options.model` > `self.model` > JSONL fallback. Completes the work begun in #235 [#225](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/225)
  - follow-up: `JsonlSubprocessRunner.handle_started_event` was silently dropping the supplementary `StartedEvent` as a same-session duplicate, so the extracted model never reached `ProgressTracker.note_event`. The filter now emits duplicates through when the event carries `meta`; true duplicates (no meta) are still dropped. Unit tests in `tests/test_runner_utils.py` previously passed because they called `translate_pi_event` directly, bypassing the base-runner filter — added a regression test covering the duplicate-with-meta path.
- detect and recover from Claude Code hanging after an MCP `tool_result` via stream-json / sdk-cli — root cause is upstream [claude-code#39700](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/39700) / [#41086](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/41086) combined with the undici idle-body timeout in `mcp-remote` ([geelen/mcp-remote#226](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote/issues/226), [#107](https://github.com/geelen/mcp-remote/issues/107)) talking to Cloudflare's remote MCP servers. The symptom "MCP tool may be hung: cloudflare-observability" was misleading — the MCP had already returned its result; the engine was silent after ingesting it [#322](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/322)
  - new engine-agnostic `_classify_jsonl_event()` in `runner.py` recognises tool_result-equivalent events across all six engines (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Gemini, AMP); `JsonlStreamState` gains a `last_tool_result_at` latch cleared only on an assistant-turn event
  - new `ProgressEdits._detect_stuck_after_tool_result()` fires when the latch has been set for ≥ `stuck_after_tool_result_timeout` (default 300 s, matches undici's 5-minute idle-body timeout) with `cpu_active=True`, frozen ring buffer ≥ 3, and no pending approval — ExitPlanMode-, Bash-, and subagent-safe
  - tiered recovery in `ProgressEdits._handle_stuck_after_tool_result()`: Tier 1 logs `progress_edits.stuck_after_tool_result` with diag; Tier 2 SIGTERMs MCP-adapter children whose `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` contains `mcp-remote` or `@modelcontextprotocol` (forces the SSE reader to error out and unblocks the parent engine); Tier 3 cancels via `cancel_event` after `stuck_after_tool_result_recovery_delay` (default 60 s) with a specific Telegram notice
  - `runners/claude.py:env()` now sets `CLAUDE_ENABLE_STREAM_WATCHDOG=1`, `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=60000`, `MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT=120000`, and `MAX_MCP_OUTPUT_TOKENS=12000` via `setdefault` — reduces incidence while the detector is the safety net; user overrides via shell env or `~/.claude/settings.json` still win
  - four new `[watchdog]` config fields: `detect_stuck_after_tool_result` (default `false` for this release, will default `true` once validated), `stuck_after_tool_result_timeout`, `stuck_after_tool_result_recovery_enabled`, `stuck_after_tool_result_recovery_delay`
  - `utils/proc_diag.py:read_cmdline()` helper for identifying adapter children; 17 new tests across engine-matrix classifier, detector gates, and tier-1/2/3 state machine
- **fix:** `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` default raised from 60000ms to 300000ms (5 min). PR #323's original 60s reinforcement of #322 proved too aggressive for `opus · max` reasoning — legitimate chain-of-thought expansion produces 60–120s SSE-idle windows between output deltas, tripping the upstream Claude CLI stream watchdog and aborting runs with "API Error: Stream idle timeout - partial response received" (observed on staging mid-reasoning with `peak_idle_seconds=91.4`). 300000ms matches the undici idle-body timeout that motivated #322 and Untether's own `stuck_after_tool_result_timeout` default, so the upstream CLI watchdog and Untether's detector now fire on compatible timescales. User-provided `CLAUDE_STREAM_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS` still wins via `setdefault` semantics. Two new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` lock in the new default and the user-override path [#342](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/342)
- **security:** Claude exec is now wrapped with `env -i KEY=VAL …` so the resolved environment at exec time is exactly the allowlist from `utils/env_policy.filtered_env()` — even when an upstream rc-file source, PAM `/etc/environment` injection, or wrapper script would otherwise re-introduce host vars after the parent's `subprocess.spawn(env=…)` is honoured. v0.35.2rc3 integration testing on `@untether_dev_bot` proved the in-process filter holds (`/proc/<untether-pid>/environ` clean) but a real `BWS_ACCESS_TOKEN` still reached Claude's Bash-tool subprocess, undermining the headline #198 promise. New `wrap_with_env_i()` helper in `utils/subprocess.py`; Claude `run_impl` swaps the resolved `cmd` for the wrap and passes `env=None` to the subprocess so we don't double-set. Pi runner left unchanged — Pi was already clean per the test report. Companion runtime audit (also new this rc): a one-shot `/proc/<claude_pid>/environ` sample on first `system.init` emits a `claude.env_audit.leaked_var` structlog WARNING when any non-allowlisted name is observed; gated by new `[security] env_audit = true` (default true). Reuses `utils/env_policy.is_allowed` (promoted from private `_is_allowed`, with a back-compat alias) so the allowlist remains a single source of truth. New `utils/env_audit.py` (~80 LOC); 9 unit tests in `tests/test_env_audit.py` plus 6 in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` covering the wrap helper, the audit gate, dedup-per-session, and the disabled-via-settings path [#361](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/361) [#198](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/198)
- **fix:** `/at <duration> <prompt>` now respects the chat's project mapping and engine — previously the delayed run fired on the global default engine with no cwd, ignoring `default_engine = "pi"` (or similar) on the project bound to the chat. `AtCommand.handle()` now snapshots `RunContext` (via `runtime.default_context_for_chat(chat_id)`) and the resolved engine (via `runtime.resolve_engine(...)`) at schedule time and threads both through `_PendingAt` to the fire-time `_RUN_JOB` call, mirroring `TriggerDispatcher.dispatch_cron`'s freeze-at-dispatch behaviour. cwd is resolved correctly downstream because `_run_engine` derives it from the forwarded context. Re-routing the chat between `/at` and fire keeps the original mapping; cancel via `/cancel` and re-issue to pick up changes. New `_FakeRuntime` test fixture in `tests/test_at_command.py` plus three new tests covering project-bound capture, unmapped-chat global-default capture, and fire-time forwarding [#362](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/362)
- **feat:** MCP catalog observability (P0#2 of #365). Claude Code's `system.init` event ships each configured MCP server as `{"name": "...", "status": "connected" | "pending" | "error" | "failed"}`; Untether now logs a structured `catalog_staleness.detected` WARNING once per (session, server, status) tuple whenever any server reports a non-`connected` status at init time. Gated by new `WatchdogSettings.detect_catalog_staleness` (default **true**, observability only — no kill/recovery action). New `_capture_mcp_catalog()` helper in `src/untether/runners/claude.py` snapshots the raw list onto `ClaudeStreamState.initial_mcp_servers` for future comparison work and dedups via `ClaudeStreamState.catalog_staleness_logged: set[tuple[str, str, str]]`. Companion experimental knob `WatchdogSettings.notify_catalog_refresh` (default **false**, opt-in) queues an `mcp_status` control_request on stdin after each `tool_result` — the parent→CLI primitive documented in Anthropic's `claude-agent-sdk-python` (`get_mcp_status()` / `reconnect_mcp_server()` / `toggle_mcp_server()`). Drain happens in `ClaudeRunner._drain_catalog_refresh()` alongside existing `_drain_auto_approve` / `_drain_auto_deny`, with `catalog.refresh_sent` INFO on success and `catalog.refresh_failed` WARN/ERROR on write errors. The upstream MCP `notifications/tools/list_changed` message hinted at in the issue is server→client only per the MCP spec and therefore cannot be injected from outside; `mcp_status` is the closest documented parent-side primitive. Request IDs use the `ut_catalog_refresh_<session_id>_<seq>` namespace so they can't collide with Claude Code's own `req_*` IDs. Ten new tests in `tests/test_claude_runner.py` cover: all-connected no-op, non-connected warning emission, per-session dedup, disabled-setting suppression, queue-on-tool_result (enabled + disabled paths), no-resume defensive no-op, drain serialisation, empty-queue no-op, ClosedResourceError recovery, and new_state propagation from `WatchdogSettings`. No behaviour change for non-Claude engines [#365](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/365)
- **fix:** the plan-bypass set populated by an approved `ExitPlanMode` (#283) is now also populated by a plain "Approve" on `Edit`/`Write`/`Bash` in plan mode. Resumed sessions where Claude skipped `ExitPlanMode` and went straight into Edits previously re-prompted the user once per tool call — observed on `@hetz_lba1_bot` v0.35.2rc1 as a 9-prompt repro for a single multi-file fix turn (one `Edit` per click, ~7 min wait between approvals, workflow effectively broken under `--permission-mode plan`). `_DIFF_PREVIEW_TOOLS` is now module-scoped in `src/untether/runners/claude.py`; `write_control_response` adds the session to `_PLAN_EXIT_APPROVED` whenever the approved tool is `ExitPlanMode` *or* in `_DIFF_PREVIEW_TOOLS`, so the first approval in a turn unlocks the rest of that session's diff_preview tools. Six new parametrized tests in `tests/test_claude_control.py` cover Edit/Write/Bash/ExitPlanMode population, the deny-doesn't-populate negative, and the non-diff-tool no-op. Verified end-to-end on `@untether_dev_bot`. Follow-up #370 will migrate this to a parent-initiated `set_permission_mode` control request once the upstream primitive is wired [#369](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/369)

### docs

- document `[triggers.server]` port-conflict troubleshooting in `docs/reference/triggers/triggers.md` with `ss -tlnp` diagnosis step and the `port = <N>` remediation [#320](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/320)

## v0.35.1 (2026-04-15)

### fixes

- diff preview approval gate no longer blocks edits after a plan is approved — the `_discuss_approved` flag now short-circuits diff preview as well as `ExitPlanMode`, so once the user approves a plan outline the next `Edit`/`Write` runs without a second approval prompt [#283](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/283)
- `scripts/healthcheck.sh` exits prematurely under `set -e` — `pass()`/`fail()` used `((var++))` which returns the pre-increment value, tripping `set -e` on the first call so only the first check ever ran and the script always exited 1. Also, the error-log count piped journalctl through `grep -c .`, which counted `-- No entries --` meta lines as matches, producing false-positive log-error counts on clean systems. Now uses explicit `var=$((var+1))` assignment and filters meta lines with `grep -vc '^-- '` [#302](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/302)

- fix multipart webhooks returning HTTP 500 — `_process_webhook` pre-read the request body for size/auth/rate-limit checks, leaving the stream empty when `_parse_multipart` called `request.multipart()`. Now the multipart reader is constructed from the cached raw body, so multipart uploads work end-to-end; also short-circuits the post-parse raw-body write so the MIME envelope isn't duplicated at `file_path` alongside the extracted file at `file_destination` [#280](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/280)
- fix webhook rate limiter never returning 429 — `_process_webhook` awaited the downstream dispatch (Telegram outbox send, `http_forward` network call, etc.) before returning 202, which capped request throughput at the dispatch rate (~1/sec for private Telegram chats) and meant the `TokenBucketLimiter` never saw a real burst. Dispatch is now fire-and-forget with exception logging, so the rate limiter drains the bucket correctly and a burst of 80 requests against `rate_limit = 60` now yields 60 × 202 + 20 × 429 [#281](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/281)
- **security:** validate callback query sender in group chats — reject button presses from unauthorised users; prevents malicious group members from approving/denying other users' tool requests [#192](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/192)
  - also validate sender on cancel button callback — the cancel handler was routed directly, bypassing the dispatch validation
- **security:** escape release tag name in notify-website CI workflow — use `jq` for proper JSON encoding instead of direct interpolation, preventing JSON injection from crafted tag names [#193](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/193)
- **security:** sanitise flag-like prompts in Gemini and AMP runners — prompts starting with `-` are space-prefixed to prevent CLI flag injection; moved `sanitize_prompt()` to base runner class for all engines [#194](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/194)
- **security:** redact bot token from structured log URLs — `_redact_event_dict` now strips bot tokens embedded in Telegram API endpoint strings, preventing credential leakage to log files and aggregation systems [#190](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/190)
- **security:** cap JSONL line buffer at 10 MB — unbounded `readline()` on engine stdout could consume all available memory if an engine emitted a single very long line (e.g. base64 image in a tool result); now truncates and logs a warning [#191](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/191)

- reduce stall warning false positives during Agent subagent work — tree CPU tracking across process descendants, child-aware 15 min threshold when child processes or elevated TCP detected, early diagnostic collection for CPU baseline, total stall warning counter that persists through recovery, improved "Waiting for child processes" notification messages [#264](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/264)
- `/ping` uptime now resets on service restart — previously the module-level start time was cached across `/restart` commands; now `reset_uptime()` is called on each service start [#234](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/234)
- add 38 missing structlog calls across 13 files — comprehensive logging audit covering auth verification, rate limiting, SSRF validation, codex runner lifecycle, topic state mutations, CLI error paths, and config validation in all engine runners [#299](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/299)
- **systemd:** stop Untether being the preferred OOM victim — systemd user services inherit `OOMScoreAdjust=200` and `OOMPolicy=stop` defaults, which made Untether's engine subprocesses preferred earlyoom/kernel OOM killer targets ahead of CLI `claude` (`oom_score_adj=0`) and orphaned grandchildren actually consuming the RAM. `contrib/untether.service` now sets `OOMScoreAdjust=-100` (documents intent; the kernel clamps to the parent baseline for unprivileged users, typically 100) and `OOMPolicy=continue` (a single OOM-killed child no longer tears down the whole unit cgroup, which previously broke every live chat at once). Docs in `docs/reference/dev-instance.md` updated. Existing installs need to copy the unit file and `systemctl --user daemon-reload`; staging picks up the change on the next `scripts/staging.sh install` cycle [#275](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/275)

### changes

- **timezone support for cron triggers** — cron schedules can now be evaluated in a specific timezone instead of the server's system time (usually UTC) [#270](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/270)
  - per-cron `timezone` field with IANA timezone names (e.g. `"Australia/Melbourne"`)
  - global `default_timezone` in `[triggers]` — per-cron `timezone` overrides it
  - DST-aware via Python's `zoneinfo` module (zero new dependencies)
  - invalid timezone names rejected at config parse time with clear error messages

- **SSRF protection for trigger outbound requests** — shared utility at `triggers/ssrf.py` blocks private/reserved IP ranges, validates URL schemes, and checks DNS resolution to prevent server-side request forgery in upcoming webhook forwarding and cron data-fetch features [#276](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/276)
  - blocks loopback, RFC 1918, link-local, CGN, multicast, reserved, IPv6 equivalents, and IPv4-mapped IPv6 bypass
  - DNS resolution validation catches DNS rebinding attacks (hostname → private IP)
  - configurable allowlist for admins who need to hit local services
  - timeout and response-size clamping utilities

- **non-agent webhook actions** — webhooks can now perform lightweight actions without spawning an agent run [#277](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/277)
  - `action = "file_write"` — write POST body to disk with atomic writes, path traversal protection, deny-glob enforcement, and on-conflict handling
  - `action = "http_forward"` — forward payload to another URL with SSRF protection, exponential backoff on 5xx, and header template rendering
  - `action = "notify_only"` — send a templated Telegram message with no agent run
  - `notify_on_success` / `notify_on_failure` flags for Telegram visibility on all action types
  - default `action = "agent_run"` preserves full backward compatibility

- **multipart form data support for webhooks** — webhooks can now accept `multipart/form-data` POSTs with file uploads [#278](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/278)
  - file parts saved with sanitised filenames, atomic writes, deny-glob and path traversal protection
  - configurable `file_destination` with template variables, `max_file_size_bytes` (default 50 MB)
  - form fields available as template variables alongside file metadata

- **data-fetch cron triggers** — cron triggers can now pull data from external sources before rendering the prompt [#279](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/279)
  - `fetch.type = "http_get"` / `"http_post"` — fetch URL with SSRF protection, configurable timeout and headers
  - `fetch.type = "file_read"` — read local file with path traversal protection and deny-globs
  - `fetch.parse_as` — parse response as `json`, `text`, or `lines`
  - fetched data injected into `prompt_template` via `store_as` variable (default `fetch_result`)
  - `on_failure = "abort"` (default) sends failure notification; `"run_with_error"` injects error into prompt
  - all fetched data prefixed with untrusted-data marker

- **hot-reload for trigger configuration** — editing `untether.toml` `[triggers]` applies changes immediately without restarting Untether or killing active runs [#269](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/269) ([#285](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/pull/285))
  - new `TriggerManager` class holds cron and webhook config; scheduler reads `manager.crons` each tick; webhook server resolves routes per-request via `manager.webhook_for_path()`
  - supports add/remove/modify of crons and webhooks, auth/secret changes, action type, multipart/file settings, cron fetch, and timezones
  - `last_fired` dict preserved across swaps to prevent double-firing within the same minute
  - unauthenticated webhooks logged at `WARNING` on reload (previously only at startup)
  - 13 new tests in `test_trigger_manager.py`; 2038 existing tests still pass

- **hot-reload for Telegram bridge settings** — `voice_transcription`, file transfer, `allowed_user_ids`, `show_resume_line`, and message-timing settings now reload without a restart [#286](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/286)
  - `TelegramBridgeConfig` unfrozen (keeps `slots=True`) and gains an `update_from(settings)` method
  - `handle_reload()` now applies changes in-place and refreshes cached loop-state copies; restart-only keys (`bot_token`, `chat_id`, `session_mode`, `topics`, `message_overflow`) still warn with `restart_required=true`
  - `route_update()` reads `cfg.allowed_user_ids` live so allowlist changes take effect on the next message

- **`/at` command for one-shot delayed runs** — schedule a prompt to run between 60s and 24h in the future with `/at 30m Check the build`; accepts `Ns`/`Nm`/`Nh` suffixes [#288](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/288)
  - pending delays tracked in-memory (lost on restart — acceptable for one-shot use)
  - `/cancel` drops pending `/at` timers before they fire
  - per-chat cap of 20 pending delays; graceful drain cancels pending scopes on shutdown
  - new module `telegram/at_scheduler.py`; command registered as `at` entry point

- **`run_once` cron flag** — `[[triggers.crons]]` entries can set `run_once = true` to fire once then auto-disable; the cron stays in the TOML and re-activates on the next config reload or restart [#288](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/288)

- **trigger visibility improvements (Tier 1)** — surface configured triggers in the Telegram UI [#271](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/271)
  - `/ping` in a chat with active triggers appends `⏰ triggers: 1 cron (daily-review, 9:00 AM daily (Melbourne))`
  - trigger-initiated runs show provenance in the meta footer: `🏷 opus 4.6 · plan · ⏰ cron:daily-review`
  - new `describe_cron(schedule, timezone)` utility renders common cron patterns in plain English; falls back to the raw expression for complex schedules
  - `RunContext` gains `trigger_source` field; `ProgressTracker.note_event` merges engine meta over the dispatcher-seeded trigger so it survives
  - `TriggerManager` exposes `crons_for_chat()`, `webhooks_for_chat()`, `cron_ids()`, `webhook_ids()` helpers

- **faster, cleaner restarts (Tier 1)** — restart gap reduced from ~15-30s to ~5s with no lost messages [#287](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/287)
  - persist last Telegram `update_id` to `last_update_id.json` and resume polling from the saved offset on startup; Telegram retains undelivered updates for 24h, so the polling gap no longer drops or re-processes messages
  - `Type=notify` systemd integration via stdlib `sd_notify` (`socket.AF_UNIX`, no dependency) — `READY=1` is sent after the first `getUpdates` succeeds, `STOPPING=1` at the start of drain
  - `RestartSec=2` in `contrib/untether.service` (was `10`) — faster restart after drain completes
  - `contrib/untether.service` also adds `NotifyAccess=main`; existing installs must copy the unit file and `systemctl --user daemon-reload`

### docs

- add update and uninstall guides + README transparency section [#305](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/305)
  - new `docs/how-to/update.md` and `docs/how-to/uninstall.md` covering pipx, pip, and source installs, plus config/data/systemd cleanup
  - README: "What Untether accesses" section (network, filesystem, process, credentials), update/uninstall one-liners in Quick Start, and cross-links throughout install/how-to pages
- comprehensive v0.35.1 documentation audit — 8 gap fills across 121 files [#306](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/306)
  - `group-chat.md`: document callback sender validation in groups (#192)
  - `security.md`: cross-reference button validation, fix misleading SSRF allowlist claim, add bot token auto-redaction tip (#190)
  - `plan-mode.md`: document auto-approval after plan approval (#283)
  - `interactive-approval.md`: admonition linking to plan bypass behaviour
  - `commands-and-directives.md`: `/ping` description now mentions uptime reset and trigger summary (#234)
  - `runners/amp/runner.md`: add `sanitize_prompt()` note matching Pi/Gemini runners (#194)
  - `troubleshooting.md`: document 10 MB engine output line cap (#191)
  - `glossary.md`: add delayed run, webhook action, and hot-reload entries

## v0.35.0 (2026-03-31)

### fixes

- render plan outline as formatted text instead of raw markdown — outline messages now use `render_markdown()` + `split_markdown_body()` so headings, bold, code, and lists display properly in Telegram [#139](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/139)
- add approve/deny buttons to the last outline message — users no longer need to scroll back up past long outlines to find the buttons [#140](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/140)
- delete outline messages on approve/deny — outline and notification messages are cleaned up immediately via module-level `_OUTLINE_REGISTRY`, and stale approval keyboard on the progress message is suppressed [#141](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/141)
- scope AskUserQuestion pending requests by channel_id — `_PENDING_ASK_REQUESTS` and `_ASK_QUESTION_FLOWS` were global dicts with no chat scoping; a pending ask in one chat would steal the next message from any other chat, causing cross-chat contamination and lost messages [#144](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/144)
  - added `channel_id` contextvar (`get_run_channel_id`/`set_run_channel_id`) to `utils/paths.py`
  - `get_pending_ask_request()` and `get_ask_question_flow()` now accept `channel_id` and filter by it
  - session cleanup now also clears stale pending asks and flows
- standalone override commands (`/planmode`, `/model`, `/reasoning`) now preserve all `EngineOverrides` fields instead of resetting unrelated overrides [#124](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/124)
- register input for system-level auto-approved control requests (Initialize, HookCallback, McpMessage, RewindFiles, Interrupt) so `updatedInput` is included in the response — prevents ZodError in Claude Code [#123](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/123)
- reduce Telegram API default timeout from 120s to 30s — a single ReadTimeout on `editMessageText` could make the bot appear unresponsive for up to 2 minutes; `getUpdates` long-poll now uses a dedicated timeout of `timeout_s + 20` so network failures are detected faster [#145](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/145)
- OpenCode error runs now show the error message instead of an empty body — `CompletedEvent.answer` falls back to `state.last_tool_error` when no prior `Text` events were emitted; covers both `StepFinish` and `stream_end_events` paths [#146](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/146), [#150](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/150)
- Pi `/continue` now captures the session ID from `SessionHeader` — `allow_id_promotion` was `False` for continue runs, preventing the resume token from being populated [#147](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/147)
- post-outline approval no longer fails with "message to be replied not found" — the "Approve Plan" button on outline messages uses the real ExitPlanMode `request_id`, so the regular approve path now sets `skip_reply=True` when outline messages were just deleted; also suppresses the redundant push notification after outline cleanup [#148](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/148)
- sanitise `text_link` entities with invalid URLs before sending to Telegram — localhost, loopback, file paths, and bare hostnames are converted to `code` entities instead, preventing silent 400 errors that drop the entire final message [#157](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/157)
- fix duplicate approval buttons after "Pause & Outline Plan" — both the progress message and outline message showed approve/deny buttons simultaneously; now only the outline message has approval buttons (with Cancel), progress keeps cancel-only; outline state resets properly for future ExitPlanMode requests [#163](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/163)
- hold ExitPlanMode request open after outline so post-outline Approve/Deny buttons persist — instead of auto-denying (which caused Claude to exit ~7s later), the control request is never responded to, keeping Claude alive while the user reads the outline [#114](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/114), [#117](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/117)
  - buttons use real `request_id` from `pending_control_requests` for direct callback routing
  - 5-minute safety timeout cleans up stale held requests
- suppress stall auto-cancel when CPU is active — extended thinking phases produce no JSONL events but the process is alive and busy; `is_cpu_active()` check prevents false-positive kills [#114](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/114)
- fix stall notification suppression when main process sleeping — CPU-active suppression now checks `process_state`; when main process is sleeping (state=S) but children are CPU-active (hung Bash tool), notifications fire instead of being suppressed; stall message now shows tool name ("Bash tool may be stuck") instead of generic "session may be stuck" [#168](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/168)
- suppress redundant cost footer on error runs — diagnostic context line already contains cost data, footer no longer duplicates it [#120](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/120)
- clarify /config default labels and remove redundant "Works with" lines [#119](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/119)
- Codex: always pass `--ask-for-approval` in headless mode — default to `never` (auto-approve all) so Codex never blocks on terminal input; `safe` permission mode still uses `untrusted` [#184](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/184)
- OpenCode: surface unsupported JSONL event types as visible Telegram warnings instead of silently dropping them — prevents silent 5-minute hangs when OpenCode emits new event types (e.g. `question`, `permission`) [#183](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/183)
- stall warnings now succinct and accurate for long-running tools — truncate "Last:" to 80 chars, recognise `command:` prefix (Bash tools), reassuring "still running" message when CPU active, drop PID diagnostics from Telegram messages, only say "may be stuck" when genuinely stuck [#188](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/188)
  - frozen ring buffer escalation now uses tool-aware "still running" message when a known tool is actively running (main sleeping, CPU active on children), instead of alarming "No progress" message
- OpenCode model name missing from footer when using default model — `build_runner()` now reads `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` to detect the configured default model so the `🏷` footer always shows the model (e.g. `openai/gpt-5.2`) even without an `untether.toml` override [#221](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/221)
- OpenCode model override hint — `/config` and engine model sub-page now show `provider/model (e.g. openai/gpt-4o)` instead of the unhelpful "from provider config", guiding users to use the required provider-prefixed format [#220](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/220)
- Codex footer missing model name — Codex runner always includes model in `StartedEvent.meta` so the footer shows the model even when no override is set [#217](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/217)
- `/planmode` command worked in non-Claude engine chats — now gated to Claude-only with a helpful message; Codex/Gemini users are directed to `/config` → Approval policy [#216](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/216)
- `/usage` showed Claude subscription data in non-Claude engine chats — now gated to subscription-supported engines with an engine-specific error message [#215](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/215)
- `/export` showed duplicate "Session Started" headers for resumed sessions — deduplicated so only the first `StartedEvent` renders [#218](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/218)
- Gemini CLI prompt injection — prompts starting with `-` were parsed as flags when passed via `-p <value>`; now uses `--prompt=<value>` to bind the value directly [#219](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/219)
- `/new` command now cancels running processes before clearing sessions — previously only cleared resume tokens, leaving old Claude/Codex/OpenCode processes running (~400 MB each), worsening memory pressure and triggering earlyoom kills [#222](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/222)
- auto-continue no longer triggers on signal deaths (rc=143/SIGTERM, rc=137/SIGKILL) — earlyoom kills have `last_event_type=user` which matched the upstream bug detection, causing a death spiral where 4 killed sessions were immediately respawned into the same memory pressure [#222](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/222)
- `/new` command triggers engine run instead of clearing sessions when `topics.enabled=false` — `/new` was only handled in `_dispatch_builtin_command` when topics were enabled; moved `/new` out of the `topics.enabled` gate to handle all modes (topic, chat session, stateless), mirroring how `/ctx` already works; also removed unreachable early routing code [#236](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/236)
- Gemini engine stuck at "starting · 0s" — Gemini CLI outputs a non-JSON warning (`MCP issues detected...`) on stdout before the first JSONL event, corrupting the line; `decode_jsonl()` now strips non-JSON prefixes by finding the first `{` and retrying parse [#231](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/231)
- `/config` Ask mode toggle inverted — `_toggle_row` default was `False` but display default was "on", causing the button to show "Ask: off" when the effective state was on; pressing it appeared to do nothing [#232](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/232)
- diff preview approval buttons not rendered after outline flow — `_outline_sent` flag in `ProgressEdits` stripped ALL subsequent approval buttons, not just outline-related ones; now only strips buttons for `DiscussApproval` actions [#233](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/233)
- prevent duplicate control response for already-handled requests [#229](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/229) ([#230](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/230))
- fix `render_markdown` entity overflow when text ends with a fenced code block — entity offsets now clamped to the UTF-16 text length after trailing newline stripping, preventing Telegram 400 errors [#59](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/59)
- `/config` now reflects project-level `default_engine` — previously showed Claude-specific buttons (Plan mode, Ask mode, etc.) for chats routed to Codex/Pi via project config [#60](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/60)
- non-Claude runners (Codex, Pi) now populate model name in `StartedEvent.meta` — footer previously showed permission mode only (e.g. `🏷 plan`) without the model [#62](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/62)
- fix liveness watchdog false positive auto-cancel on long-running sessions — actively working sessions with CPU activity and TCP connections were being killed during extended thinking/processing phases [#115](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/115)
- fix reply-to resume when emoji prefix is present — the `↩️` prefix on resume footer lines broke all 6 engine regexes; `extract_resume()` now strips emoji prefixes before matching [#134](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/134)
- `/config` sub-pages now show resolved on/off values instead of "default" — body text now matches the toggle button state using `_resolve_default()`, removing the confusing mismatch [#152](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/152)
- expired control requests now auto-denied after 5-minute timeout — previously the timeout cleanup removed local tracking but did not send a deny response, leaving the Claude subprocess blocked indefinitely on stdin [#32](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/32)
- `/export` no longer returns sessions from wrong chat — session recording was not scoped by channel_id, so `/export` in one chat could return another engine's session data [#33](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/33)
- fix `KillMode=control-group` bypassing drain and causing 150s restart delay — `contrib/untether.service` now uses `KillMode=mixed` which sends SIGTERM to the main process first (drain works), then SIGKILL to remaining cgroup processes (orphaned MCP servers, containers cleaned up instantly) [#166](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/166)
  - `process`: orphaned children survive across restarts, accumulating memory (#88)
  - `control-group`: kills all processes simultaneously, bypassing drain (#166)
  - `mixed`: best of both — graceful drain then forced cleanup
- AMP CLI `-x` flag regression — double-dash separator in `build_args()` caused AMP to interpret `-x` as a subcommand name instead of a flag, breaking execute mode for all prompts [#245](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/245)

### docs

- update integration test chat IDs from stale `ut-dev:` to current `ut-dev-hf:` chats [#238](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/238)
- investigation: orphaned `workerd` processes from Bash tool children are upstream Claude Code bug — Untether's process group cleanup is correct; Claude Code spawns Bash tool shells in their own session group which Untether cannot reach; no TTY/SIGHUP cascade in headless mode [#257](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/257)

### changes

- logging audit: fill gaps in structlog coverage — elevate settings loader failures from DEBUG to WARNING (footer, watchdog, auto-continue, preamble), add access control drop logging, add executor `handle.engine_resolved` info log, elevate outline cleanup failures to WARNING, add credential redaction for OpenAI/GitHub API keys, add file transfer success logging, bind `session_id` in structlog context vars, add media group/cost tracker/cancel debug logging [#254](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/254)
- CI: expand ruff lint rules from 7 to 18 — add ASYNC, LOG, I (isort), PT, RET, RUF (full), FURB, PIE, FLY, FA, ISC rule sets; auto-fix 42 import sorts, clean 73 stale noqa directives, fix unused vars and useless conditionals; per-file ignores for test-specific patterns [#255](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/255)
- Gemini: default to `--approval-mode yolo` (full access) when no override is set — headless mode has no interactive approval path, so the CLI's read-only default disabled write tools entirely, causing multi-minute stalls as Gemini cascaded through sub-agents [#244](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/244), [#248](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/248)
- expand error hints coverage — add model not found, context length exceeded, authentication, content safety, CLI not installed, SSL/TLS, invalid request, disk/permission, AMP-specific auth, Gemini result status, and account suspension error categories [#246](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/246)
- `/continue` command — cross-environment resume; pick up the most recent CLI session from Telegram using each engine's native continue flag (`--continue`, `resume --last`, `--resume latest`); supported for Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Gemini (not AMP) [#135](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/135)
  - `ResumeToken` extended with `is_continue: bool = False`
  - all 6 runners' `build_args()` updated to handle continue tokens
  - `/continue` handled as reserved command in Telegram loop
  - new how-to guide: `docs/how-to/cross-environment-resume.md`
- `/config` UX overhaul — 2-column toggle pattern replaces all 3-button rows with single `[✓ Feature: on]` toggle + `[Clear]` for better mobile tap targets; merged Engine + Model into single page; max 2 buttons per row on home page; plan mode 2+1 split layout [#132](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/132)
- resume line toggle — per-chat `show_resume_line` override via `/config` settings; configurable via EngineOverrides [#128](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/128)
- cost budget settings — per-chat `budget_enabled` and `budget_auto_cancel` overrides on Cost & Usage page in `/config` [#129](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/129)
- model metadata improvements — shorten model display names in footer: `claude-opus-4-6[1m]` → `opus 4.6 (1M)`, `auto-gemini-3` → `gemini-3`; all engines populate model info from `StartedEvent.meta` [#132](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/132)
- resume line formatting — visual separation with blank line and `↩️` prefix in final message footer [#127](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/127)
- agent-initiated file delivery — agents write files to `.untether-outbox/` during a run; Untether sends them as Telegram documents on completion with `📎 filename (size)` captions; flat scan, deny-glob security, size limits, auto-cleanup [#143](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/143)
  - new module `telegram/outbox_delivery.py` with `scan_outbox()`, `cleanup_outbox()`, `deliver_outbox_files()`
  - `ExecBridgeConfig` gains `send_file` callback + `outbox_config` (transport-agnostic)
  - preamble updated with outbox instructions for all 6 engines
  - config: `outbox_enabled`, `outbox_dir`, `outbox_max_files`, `outbox_cleanup` in `[transports.telegram.files]`
- orphan progress message cleanup on restart — active progress messages are persisted to `active_progress.json`; on startup, orphan messages from a prior instance are edited to show "⚠️ interrupted by restart" with no keyboard [#149](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/149)
  - new module `telegram/progress_persistence.py` with `register_progress()`, `unregister_progress()`, `load_active_progress()`, `clear_all_progress()`
  - `runner_bridge.py` registers on progress send, unregisters on ephemeral cleanup
  - `telegram/loop.py` cleans up orphans before sending startup message
- expand pre-run permission policies for Codex CLI and Gemini CLI in `/config` [#131](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/131)
  - Codex: new "Approval policy" page — full auto (default) or safe (`--ask-for-approval untrusted`)
  - Gemini: expanded approval mode from 2 to 3 tiers — read-only, edit files (`--approval-mode auto_edit`), full access
  - both engines show "Agent controls" section on `/config` home page with engine-specific labels
- suppress stall Telegram notifications when CPU-active; heartbeat re-render keeps elapsed time counter ticking during extended thinking phases [#121](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/121)
- temporary debug logging for hold-open callback routing — will be removed after dogfooding confirms [#118](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/118) is resolved
- auto-continue mitigation for Claude Code bug — when Claude Code exits after receiving tool results without processing them (bugs [#34142](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34142), [#30333](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/30333)), Untether detects via `last_event_type=user` and auto-resumes the session [#167](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/167)
  - `AutoContinueSettings` with `enabled` (default true) and `max_retries` (default 1) in `[auto_continue]` config section
  - detection based on protocol invariant: normal sessions always end with `last_event_type=result`
  - sends "⚠️ Auto-continuing — Claude stopped before processing tool results" notification before resuming
- emoji button labels and edit-in-place for outline approval — ExitPlanMode buttons now show ✅/❌/📋 emoji prefixes; post-outline "Approve Plan"/"Deny" edits the "Asked Claude Code to outline the plan" message in-place instead of creating a second message [#186](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/186)
- redesign startup message layout — version in parentheses, split engine info into "default engine" and "installed engines" lines, italic subheadings, renamed "projects" to "directories" (matching `dir:` footer label), added bug report link [#187](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/187)
- show token usage counts for non-Claude engines — completion footer now displays `💰 26.0k in / 71 out` for Codex, OpenCode, Pi, Gemini, and Amp when token data is available [#36](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/36)
- include CLI versions in startup diagnostics — startup message now shows detected engine CLI versions for easier debugging of outdated or mismatched tools [#38](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/38)

### tests

- 8 new outline UX tests: markdown rendering with entities, approval keyboard on last chunk, multi-chunk keyboard placement, ref tracking, deletion on approval transition, deletion on keyboard change, safety-net cleanup, no double-deletion [#139](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/139), [#140](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/140), [#141](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/141)

- 99 new `/continue` tests: 46 auto-router assertions (continue token handling, engine routing) + 53 build-args assertions (continue flags for all 6 engines) [#135](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/135)
- 195 `/config` tests covering home page, all sub-pages, toggle actions, callback routing, button layout, engine-aware visibility [#132](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/132)
- 7 new OpenCode error message tests: Error event with no prior text, process_error_events, stream_end_events, last_tool_error fallback on StepFinish, last_text takes priority over tool error, tool error status captures last_tool_error, stream_end_events fallback [#146](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/146), [#150](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/150)
- 3 new Pi /continue tests: allow_id_promotion flag, session ID promotion from SessionHeader, normal resume no promotion [#147](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/147)
- 3 new timeout tests: default 30s timeout, getUpdates per-request timeout, sendMessage uses default [#145](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/145)
- 3 new discuss-approval skip_reply tests: approve and deny results set skip_reply=True, dispatch callback skip_reply sends without reply_to [#148](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/148)
- 8 new progress persistence tests: register/load roundtrip, unregister, missing file, corrupt file, non-dict, multiple entries, clear all, clear nonexistent [#149](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/149)
- 2 new dual-button tests: outline strips approval from progress, outline state resets on approval disappear [#163](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/163)
- hold-open outline flow: new tests for hold-open path, real request_id buttons, pending cleanup, approval routing [#114](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/114)
- stall suppression: tests for CPU-active auto-cancel, notification suppression when cpu_active=True, notification fires when cpu_active=False [#114](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/114), [#121](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/121)
- cost footer: tests for suppression on error runs, display on success runs [#120](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/120)
- 10 new auto-continue tests: detection function (bug scenario, non-claude engine, cancelled session, normal result, no resume, max retries) + settings validation (defaults, bounds) [#167](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/167)
- 2 new stall sleeping-process tests: notification not suppressed when main process sleeping (state=S), stall message includes tool name [#168](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/168)
- 8 new `_read_opencode_default_model` tests: valid config, missing file, invalid JSON, empty model, no model key, build_runner fallback, untether config priority, no OC config [#221](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/221)
- engine command gate tests: `/planmode` Claude-only, `/usage` subscription-engine-only [#215](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/215), [#216](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/216)
- export dedup test: duplicate started events deduplicated in markdown export [#218](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/218)
- Gemini `--prompt=` build_args test [#219](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/219)
- Gemini integration test stall diagnosed — root cause was missing `--approval-mode yolo` in test chat config; Gemini CLI defaults to read-only mode with write tools disabled; set full access via `/config` for `ut-dev-hf: gemini` test chat; U1 now passes in 56s (was 8–18 min stall) [#244](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/244)
- 10 new `/new` cancellation tests: `_cancel_chat_tasks` helper (None, empty, matching, other chats, already cancelled, multiple), chat `/new` with running task, cancel-only no sessions, no tasks no sessions, topic `/new` with running task [#222](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/222)
- 12 new auto-continue signal death tests: `_is_signal_death` (SIGTERM, SIGKILL, negative, normal, None), `_should_auto_continue` (rc=143, rc=137, rc=-9, rc=-15 blocked; rc=0, rc=None, rc=1 allowed), `proc_returncode` default on `JsonlStreamState` [#222](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/222)

### docs

- document OpenCode lack of auto-compaction as a known limitation — long sessions accumulate unbounded context with no automatic trimming; added to runner docs and integration testing playbook [#150](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/150)

## v0.34.4 (2026-03-09)

### fixes

- preamble hook awareness: add constraint to default preamble instructing Claude that if hooks fire at session end, the final response must still contain the user's requested content — hook concerns are secondary and should be noted after main content, never instead of it [#107](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/107)
  - addresses content displacement when Claude Code plugin Stop hooks (e.g. PitchDocs context-guard) consume the final Telegram message with meta-commentary instead of user-requested content
- `UNTETHER_SESSION` env var: Claude runner now sets `UNTETHER_SESSION=1` in subprocess environment, enabling Claude Code hooks to detect Untether sessions and adjust behaviour (e.g. PitchDocs context-guard skips blocking Stop hooks in Telegram) [#107](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/107)

### docs

- audit: PitchDocs context-guard interference analysis — root cause (false positive from `git status --porcelain` on untracked hook infrastructure), cross-project comparison (BIP/Scout/Brand Copilot/littlebearapps.com), recommendations for both Untether and PitchDocs [#107](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/107)

## v0.34.3 (2026-03-08)

### fixes

- tool-aware stall threshold: 10-minute threshold (`_STALL_THRESHOLD_TOOL = 600s`) when a tool action is started but not completed, preventing false stall warnings during long-running Bash commands, Agent tasks, and TaskOutput waits [#105](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/105)
  - three-tier system: normal (5 min), running tool (10 min), pending approval (30 min)
  - `_has_running_tool()` checks most recent action state
  - stall threshold selection logged at info level with reason
- progress message edit failure: log warning and fall back to sending a new message when the initial "queued" → "starting" edit fails, preventing stuck "queued" messages [#103](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/103)
- approval keyboard edit failure: use `wait=True` for keyboard transitions (approval buttons appearing), log keyboard attach at info level and edit failures at warning level for diagnostics [#104](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/104)
  - `transport.edit.failed` warning in `TelegramTransport.edit()` when `wait=True` edit returns `None`
  - `progress_edits.keyboard_attach` info log on keyboard transitions
  - `progress_edits.keyboard_edit_failed` warning when keyboard edit fails
  - transport errors upgraded from debug to warning level
- `/usage` 429 rate limit: downgrade from error to warning level, preventing untether-issue-watcher noise for transient rate limits [#89](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/89)

### changes

- session cleanup structured reporting: `_cleanup_session_registries()` now logs cleaned registry names at info level for post-mortem analysis [#93](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/93)
  - session registration (`claude_runner.registered`, `session_stdin.registered`) upgraded to info level
- JSONL decode failure logged at warning level with truncated line content (first 200 chars)
- runner spawn now logs CLI args in `runner.start` event
- no-events session warning: `session.summary.no_events` logged when a non-cancelled session completes with zero events

### tests

- new test coverage for tool-aware stall threshold, keyboard edit failure recovery, edit-fail fallback send, session cleanup tracking, stderr sanitisation [#85](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/85), build args validation, loop coverage

## v0.34.2 (2026-03-08)

### fixes

- stall monitor loops forever after laptop sleep — no auto-cancel, `/cancel` requires reply [#99](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/99)
  - stall auto-cancel: dead process detection (immediate), no-PID zombie cap (3 warnings), absolute cap (10 warnings)
  - early PID threading: `last_pid` set at subprocess spawn, polled by `run_runner_with_cancel` before `StartedEvent`
  - standalone `/cancel` fallback: cancels single active run without requiring reply; prompts when multiple runs active
  - `queued_for_chat()` method on `ThreadScheduler` for standalone cancel of queued jobs
  - approval-aware stall threshold: 30 min when waiting for user approval (inline keyboard detected), 5 min otherwise

## v0.34.1 (2026-03-07)

### fixes

- session stall diagnostics: add `/proc` process diagnostics (CPU, RSS, TCP, FDs, children), progressive stall warnings, liveness watchdog, event timeline tracking, and session completion summary [#97](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/97)
  - new `utils/proc_diag.py` module: `collect_proc_diag()`, `format_diag()`, `is_cpu_active()`
  - `JsonlStreamState` tracks `last_stdout_at`, `event_count`, `last_event_type`, `recent_events` ring buffer, `stderr_capture`
  - PID auto-injected into `StartedEvent.meta` via base class (all engines)
  - progressive `_stall_monitor`: repeating warnings every 3 min with fresh `/proc` snapshots and Telegram notifications
  - liveness watchdog: detects alive-but-silent subprocesses after 10 min with diagnostics; optional auto-kill (off by default, triple safety gate)
  - `session.summary` structured log on every session completion
  - `[watchdog]` config section: `liveness_timeout`, `stall_auto_kill`, `stall_repeat_seconds`
- stream threading broken: `_ResumeLineProxy` hides `current_stream` from `ProgressEdits`, causing `event_count=0` and `last_event_type=None` for all engines [#98](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/98)
  - add `current_stream` property to `_ResumeLineProxy` and `_PreludeRunner`
  - set `self.current_stream = stream` in Claude's overridden `run_impl`
  - use `stream.stderr_capture` instead of separate `stderr_lines` in Claude's `run_impl`

## v0.34.0 (2026-03-07)

### fixes

- ExitPlanMode stuck after cancel + resume: stale outline_guard not cleaned up [#93](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/93)
  - extract `_cleanup_session_registries()` helper, call from `run_impl` finally block
- stall monitor fails to detect stalls when no events arrive after session start; no Telegram notification [#95](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/95)
  - initialise `_last_event_at` from `clock()` instead of `0.0` so threshold works from session start
  - send `⏳ No progress for N min` Telegram notification on stall detection (previously journal-only)

### changes

- show token-only cost footer for Gemini and AMP — `_format_run_cost()` no longer requires `total_cost_usd`; renders `💰 26.0k in / 71 out` when only token data is available [#94](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/94)
  - Gemini `_build_usage()`: extract `cached` → `cache_read_tokens` and `duration_ms` from StreamStats
  - AMP `_accumulate_usage()`: accumulate `cache_creation_input_tokens` and `cache_read_input_tokens`
- add Gemini CLI approval mode toggle in `/config` — "read-only" (default, write tools blocked) or "full access" (`--approval-mode=yolo`); tied into existing plan mode infrastructure via shared `permission_mode` field [#90](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/90)
  - home page shows "Approval mode" label and button when engine is Gemini
  - sub-page with Read-only/Full access toggle
  - `PERMISSION_MODE_SUPPORTED_ENGINES` constant for engine-aware gating

## v0.33.5 (2026-03-07)

### fixes

- downgrade `control_response.failed` ClosedResourceError from error to warning — race condition when Telegram callback arrives after session stdin closes; `write_control_response()` now returns `bool` and `send_claude_control_response()` propagates it [#61](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/61)
  - also downgrade `auto_approve_failed` and `auto_deny_failed` for consistency
- add subprocess watchdog — detects orphaned child processes (e.g. MCP servers) holding stdout pipes open after parent exits; kills process group after grace period [#91](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/91)
- add stall monitor — warns when no progress events arrive for 5 minutes; clears on recovery [#92](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/92)
- handle `ClosedResourceError` in `iter_bytes_lines()` on abrupt pipe close

## v0.33.4 (2026-03-06)

### fixes

- add render debouncing to batch rapid progress events — configurable `min_render_interval` (default 2.0s) prevents flooding Telegram edits [#88](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/88)
  - first render is never debounced; subsequent renders sleep for remaining interval
  - `group_chat_rps` now configurable in `[progress]` (default 20/60, matching Telegram limit)
- make approval notification sends non-blocking — `transport.send()` for push notifications runs in a background task instead of stalling the render loop [#88](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/88)

### docs

- document `KillMode=process` → `KillMode=control-group` fix for systemd service files — orphaned MCP servers accumulate across restarts, consuming 10+ GB [#88](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/88)

## v0.33.3 (2026-03-06)

### fixes

- block ExitPlanMode after cooldown expires when no outline has been written — adds outline guard check before time-based cooldown [#87](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/87)

### fixes

- warn at startup when `allowed_user_ids` is empty — any chat member can run commands without filtering [#84](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/84)
- sanitise subprocess stderr before exposing to Telegram — redact absolute file paths and URLs [#85](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/85)
- truncate prompts to 100 chars in INFO logs to reduce sensitive data exposure [#86](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/86)

## v0.33.1 (2026-03-06)

### fixes

- fall back to plain commonmark renderer when `linkify-it-py` is missing instead of crash-looping on startup [#83](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/83)

## v0.33.0 (2026-03-06)

- config reasoning page showed bare "Claude" instead of "Claude Code" due to `.capitalize()` [#81](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/81)
- `/usage` HTTP errors now show descriptive messages (e.g. "Rate limited by Anthropic — too many requests") instead of bare status codes [#81](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/81)
- `/usage` now handles ConnectError and TimeoutException with specific recovery guidance [#81](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/81)
- add error hints for "finished without a result event" and "finished but no session_id" — covers all 6 engines [#81](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/81)

### docs

- update 27 documentation files with Claude Code naming

## v0.28.1 (2026-03-03)

### changes

- add 20 new API/LLM error hints for graceful failure during provider outages [#54](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/54)
  - subscription limits: Claude "out of extra usage" / "hit your limit" — tells user session is saved, wait for reset

  - API overload: Anthropic `overloaded_error` (529), generic "server is overloaded"
  - server errors: 500 `internal_server_error`, 502 `bad gateway`, 503 `service unavailable`, 504 `gateway timeout`
  - rate limits: `too many requests` (extends existing `rate limit` pattern)

  - `/config` toggle: "Ask mode" sub-page (Claude-only) to enable/disable interactive questions
  - dynamic preamble encourages or discourages AskUserQuestion based on toggle state
  - auto-deny when toggle is OFF — Claude proceeds with defaults instead of asking
- Gemini CLI and Amp engine runners added (coming soon — not yet released for production use)

### fixes

  - session-alive check in `da:` button handler (`claude_control.py`)
  - stale `_REQUEST_TO_SESSION` entries cleaned up during session end
- ReadTimeout in usage footer no longer kills final message delivery — chat appeared frozen when Anthropic usage API was slow [#53](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/53)

### tests

  - `_next_at[chat_id]` dict replaces scalar `next_at`
  - new `_pick_ready(now)` selects from unblocked chats; `retry_at` stays global (429)

- ExceptionGroup unwrapping, transport resilience, and debug logging improvements [#30](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/30)

### fixes

- outline not visible in Pause & Outline Plan flow — outline was scrolled off by max_actions truncation and lost in final message [#28](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/28)
- footer double-spacing — sulguk trailing `\n\n` caused blank lines between footer items (context/meta/resume) [#29](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/29)

### docs

- add dev instance quickref (`docs/reference/dev-instance.md`) documenting production vs dev separation
- add dev workflow rule (`.claude/rules/dev-workflow.md`) preventing accidental production restarts

## v0.24.0 (2026-02-27)

### changes

- agent context preamble — configurable `[preamble]` injects Telegram context into every runner prompt, informing agents they're on Telegram and requesting structured end-of-task summaries; engine-agnostic (Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Pi) [#21](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/21)
- post-outline Approve/Deny buttons — after "Pause & Outline Plan", Claude writes the outline then Approve/Deny buttons appear automatically in Telegram; no need to type "approved" [#22](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/22)

### fixes

- improved discuss denial message for resumed sessions — explicitly tells Claude to rewrite the outline even if one exists in prior context [#23](https://github.com/littlebearapps/untether/issues/23)
