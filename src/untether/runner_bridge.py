    CLOSED/COMPLETED upstream) and claude-code#30333 (ResultMessage never
    emitted with background subagents; CLOSED/NOT_PLANNED — permanent).

    silently drop recovery for a defect upstream has declined to fix, so the
    mitigation is KEPT and the relevant fields are logged on
    `session.auto_continue` instead, to build the evidence a future
    narrowing would need. Do not re-introduce issue-number branching here
