"""Minimal sd_notify client (stdlib only).

systemd's ``Type=notify`` services use the ``$NOTIFY_SOCKET`` environment
variable to signal readiness and state changes. This module sends datagrams
to that socket with no external dependency.

Messages of interest:
- ``READY=1`` — sent after the bot has finished startup and is serving
  updates. Until this is sent, systemd keeps the unit in "activating".
- ``STOPPING=1`` — sent at the start of the drain sequence so that
  ``systemctl status`` shows "Deactivating" rather than "Active".

When ``NOTIFY_SOCKET`` is absent (non-systemd runs, dev containers,
pytest), ``notify()`` is a no-op returning ``False`` and does not raise.
