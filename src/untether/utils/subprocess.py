    Locates ``env`` via ``shutil.which`` with a ``/usr/bin/env`` fallback.
    Caller should pass ``env=None`` to ``manage_subprocess`` when using this
    wrap, so subprocess.exec doesn't double-set the environment.

    Security trade-off: ``KEY=VALUE`` pairs sit in ``env``'s argv during the
    fork/exec window before ``env`` exec's into the wrapped program. After
    exec, ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` reports the *new* program's argv (verified:
    ``env -i FOO=bar sleep 5`` shows ``sleep 5`` post-exec), so the only
    exposure is a microsecond window on ``env``'s own PID. The secrets remain
    in the spawned program's ``/proc/<pid>/environ`` which is per-user
    permission-protected. We accept this over the alternative of relying
    solely on ``subprocess.spawn(env=…)`` because v0.35.2rc3 testing on
    ``@untether_dev_bot`` proved that an upstream rc-file source / wrapper
    script can re-introduce host vars after Python's ``execve`` honoured the
