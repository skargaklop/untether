    ``run_in_background: false`` for a synchronous run." The flag is therefore
    normally ABSENT from `input` — the observed shape is just

    The pre-#646 predicate was ``bool(raw_input.get("run_in_background"))``,
    which read an omitted key as *foreground*. That inverted the upstream
    default and missed every real background subagent (measured: 11/11 Agent
    calls across the 5 sessions quarantined on nsd 2026-07-18 omit the key).
    An unregistered handle leaves `has_live_background_work()` False, so the

    timeout, SIGTERMs a subprocess whose subagents are still working, and the
    #632 forced-teardown path then quarantines a perfectly healthy session —

    handle only forfeits the 60s shortcut while the 600s post-result ceiling
    and the 900s ``BG_AGENT_MAX_KEEP_S`` age-out both still bound teardown.
    Under-registering force-kills live work and poisons the session.

    its own bounded deadline so neither risks keeping a handle forever:

    - **Monitor** feeds back the watched command's **raw stdout lines as they
      appear** (see ``docs/plans/2026-05-06-289-loop-and-cron-interception.md``),
      so clearing ``live_monitors`` on the first line dropped the
      ``stall_monitor_active_suppressed`` branch while the Monitor was still
      running. Its bound is the primitive's own ``timeout_ms`` deadline
      (``has_live_background_work`` already uses the same deadline to age the
      handle out — so no leak).

    - **Agent/Task running in the background** (rc7, #374) — i.e. every Agent/Task
      except an explicit ``run_in_background=False``, since background is the
      upstream default (#646, ``_agent_runs_in_background``). These likewise emit
      an interim tool_result (observed: ``"Async agent launched successfully."``
      ~25ms after the tool_use) before the subagent actually finishes. Clearing
      ``live_bg_agents`` on that first result reintroduced the same premature-drain
      bug the Monitor fix addressed: it poisoned the "no live background work"
      signal the empty-resume detector relies on (#596). There is no reliable
      upstream completion signal for Agent/Task yet (true-terminal detection via
      KillShell, subprocess-exit reconciliation, and child-PID cleanup is the
      v0.35.5 lifecycle refactor, #573), so its bound is the fixed
      ``BG_AGENT_MAX_KEEP_S`` deadline set at register time in
      ``_register_background_handle`` — the safe trade-off between "keep
      suppressing stall warnings while genuinely running" and "never leave a
      handle uncleared forever".

    Because tool_result text is arbitrary in both cases (Monitor: raw command
    stdout; Agent/Task: subagent-authored prose), we deliberately do NOT scan it
    for "completed"/"cancelled" markers for either primitive — that is unreliable
    in both directions (a build printing "Done" mid-stream would false-clear and
    reintroduce the bug; a real completion that doesn't print a magic word would be
    missed). The reliable terminal signals are ``is_error`` and the primitive's own
    bounded deadline.

    Every other tool_result — including Bash-bg, ScheduleWakeup, and
    RemoteTrigger, whose true-terminal detection remains deferred to the v0.35.5
    refactor (#573) — is treated as terminal, preserving the pre-#374
    clear-on-first-result behaviour for foreground tools and those primitives.

    this run's stream, not the shared ``runner.current_stream`` singleton.

    #515 length-gate tuning (rc13). The original substring check
    (``body in final_answer``) failed in practice because the rc11
    preamble told Claude to *paraphrase* the plan post-approval rather
    than literal-copy it, so the skip never triggered and Layer E
    concatenated the full plan body in front of every well-behaved run
    (42k-char Telegram messages on staging). The new preamble asks for a
    brief CLI-style summary post-approval — when Claude obeys, the
    answer is >600 chars and we skip the prepend; when Claude exits with
    nothing substantive (the original #508 repro at 584 chars), the
    length gate falls through and we prepend a capped plan body.

    Skip rules (in order):
    1. ``plan_body`` empty/whitespace → return final answer as-is.
    2. ``final_answer`` already substantive (≥ ``_PREPEND_LENGTH_GATE``)
       → skip prepend, post-approval text is doing the job.
    3. Exact substring match → skip prepend (cheap belt-and-braces).
    4. Otherwise prepend, truncating ``plan_body`` to
       ``_PREPEND_BODY_CAP`` chars so a runaway plan body doesn't ship

            #   approval where applicable). A compromised MCP server CAN send

            #   threat model of any MCP server — not specific to auto-approve.

            #   payload (it's already in-flight) — it would just delay the
            #   acknowledgement, with no security gain.
            #
            # * `ControlRewindFilesRequest` (subtype=rewind_files). Carries
            #   `user_message_id: str`. Rewind is initiated by the user via
            #   the Claude CLI's `/rewind` slash command (or programmatic
            #   equivalent) — the model cannot autonomously trigger rewind

            #   has already consented. If a future release exposes rewind
            #   via Telegram UI, that UI's command handler should provide
            #   the gate, not this control-channel layer. The denial state

            #   parent (Untether) side in `_HANDLED_REQUESTS` /

        After ``StreamResultMessage`` the Claude CLI stays alive in the

        re-spawn. In practice (#333) this leaves a 400 MB RSS subprocess
        plus ~200 TCP sockets idling for 30+ minutes between user prompts.

        Mechanism: poll ``state.result_received_at``. When elapsed exceeds
        ``timeout_s`` and no approval-state references the session, close
        ``this_proc_stdin`` (same call as the normal-flow exit on line
        2412). The CLI hits stdin EOF and exits gracefully (rc=0). The
        auto-continue safety gate excludes ``last_event_type == "result"``
        so the clean exit will not phantom-resume the session
        (test_skips_result_event_type in test_exec_bridge.py locks this).

        Approval-state guard: ``_REQUEST_TO_SESSION`` and

        the JSONL reader exhausted but the subprocess is still alive (Claude
        Code v2.1.143 sometimes closes stdout without exiting). We wait up
        to ``timeout_s`` for the subprocess to exit naturally; if it doesn't,
        SIGTERM the process group, wait 5 s, then SIGKILL. Returns the
        ``task_exited`` reason for the caller to record.

        Tier 3: 30 s into the subcountdown, if the subprocess is still
        alive and no real pending state references the session, emit
        ``runner.limbo_detected`` warning. ``untether-issue-watcher``
        picks this up automatically.

        #647/#646: the deadline is liveness-aware — when it expires while the
        session still has live background work (upstream runs subagents in
        the background by default since Claude Code v2.1.198, and their
        completion is NOT signalled on stream-json) and the process tree is
        not demonstrably idle, the SIGTERM is deferred and re-checked each
        poll, bounded by ``bg_max_hold_s``. Killing live subagent work
        quarantines the session (#632) and produces fresh-session amnesia.

        #650: every ~30 s of the countdown emits a
        ``claude.post_result_idle.subcountdown_tick`` INFO — previously the
        loop logged nothing between the one-shot ``limbo_detected`` and its
        exit, a blackout window in which the bridge's independent stall
        detector raced this loop's returncode poll and mislabelled a normal
